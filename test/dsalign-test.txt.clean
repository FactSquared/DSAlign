to announce a strong start to the year with excellent performance in both our equipment and soft goods businesses revenues were up overall driven by a growth in our equipment business and increase in our soft goods business driven by the recent acquisition of jack wolfskin as well as continued strong performance in both the travismathew and callaway brands revenues increased in all operating segments and all major product categories and regions based on this start to the year and despite negative fx headwinds we believe we are on track for another strong year of growth and we're pleased to increase our eps guidance for the full year as this is my custom i'd like to take this chance to thank the callaway golf team for the hard work required in transforming the company over the last several years like me i'm sure our team realizes that we have a lot more opportunity in front of us and it remains motivated to continuously improve let's now take a look at our operating performance by business segment turning to slide of the presentation our equipment business had a strong quarter with revenues up driven by market conditions that varied widely by region but met expectations overall as usual we believe we grew faster than the market which we believe was approximately flat in the first quarter and that with the exception of short term quarterly variations and launch timing we are positioned to continue to do so over the long run this year to date we are demonstrating strength across the breadth of our club lineup with our new epic flash driver apex irons and stroke lab putters all doing well our golf ball business also continues to do extremely well with currency neutral revenue growth of for the quarter the market reaction to triple track technology and our new erc golf balls has been excellent and our us market shares continue to set records on the brand side we've had a strong start to the year on tour with multiple golf balls and driver wins across the globe and as part of a new strategic initiative we have earned the claim of being the new number one driver on major worldwide tours and we continue to be the number one putter on tour we also received great feedback on our brand according to golf datatech's spring golf product attitude and usage study callaway has moved into either the top spot or a statistical tie for that spot in every major golf club consumer measure and the brand continues to show resilience and continued upward mobility in golf balls as well as in clubs the brand also has the highest net brand rating total brand rating and for the first time in over a decade is the leader or statistically tied for the lead in innovation and technology these results are great testament to both our latent brand strength and our team's execution over the last several years perhaps even more importantly we believe we are doing the right things to build on our strength here turning to slide in our soft goods segment revenues surged due to the recent acquisition of jack wolfskin as well as strong performance across the majority of our brand and business portfolio travismathew is worthy of a special call out here as that business continues to deliver double digit growth and we remain energized about its future the jack wolfskin business met expectations for the quarter but our outlook for the full year is declined due to foreign exchange headwinds as well as softer than expected market conditions in its key markets of central europe and china which have led to lower than anticipated pre books for the fall winter season as a result of this we're anticipating our ebitda from this business will be lower than initially expected and we reflected this in our current guidance we believe these short term issues our soft goods business is the large and rapidly growing segment of our company we are confident and excited about the long term outlook and potential here we also continue to reinvest back in our business with several key infrastructure projects underway many of which will extend through mid these include the before mentioned chicopee ball plant capital project which now is in its final year multiple distribution center expansion projects all aimed at increased capacity and efficiency as well as several it systems upgrades and convergence related to both our recent acquisitions and growth ambitions we are also in process of establishing organizational infrastructure for our new brands in key markets where they're not currently operating these projects are progressing nicely and we'll set the foundation for continued future growth now on slide we believe we are on track for our full year results and are thus confirming revenue and ebitda guidance and raising eps guidance based on slightly lower financing costs and tax projections these projections have us overcoming a significant fx headwind whether that was less than desired to start the year and slower than expected market conditions for our apparel business in china and europe we are pleased that the golf industry remains in a healthy position and we believe we are well positioned to continue our leadership positions in the industry we also remain energized by the jack wolfskin acquisition and are both getting our arms around this business quickly and from all we are learning we are increasingly confident about the business for the long term it's successful in achieving these financial results our adjusted ebitda will be up double digits first last year and nearly two times what it was only two years ago this is the type of growth in increased scale that we have been targeting with our investments and growth initiatives in addition to revenue and ebitda growth we anticipate further strengthening of all the brands in our portfolio and believe we are trending accordingly we also believe our reinvestments in long term oriented management decisions are setting the stage for continued long term strength in revenue growth and earnings brian over to you thank you chip as chip mentioned we're pleased with our strong start to the year with good performance in both our golf equipment and soft goods businesses we achieved record net sales in the quarter and growth in adjusted ebitda compared to the first quarter of and we delivered these results despite further foreign exchange headwinds in a flat golf market in the first quarter despite these headwinds today we expect to achieve our plan and are reiterating our net sales and adjusted ebitda guidance although we are lowering our guidance for the jack wolfskin business in we remain excited about the long term prospects of this business and believe our other businesses will cover the short term effects of the softer market conditions in central europe and china are having upon the jack wolfskin business all in all we remain focused on transforming callaway into a premium golf equipment and active lifestyle company and are energized by the long term revenue growth and earnings potential this opportunity presents evaluating our results for the first quarter you should keep in mind some specific factors that affect year over year comparisons first the jack wolfskin acquisition occurred in january as a result that business was not included in our results second as a result of the jack wolfskin acquisition we encourage some non recurring transaction and transition related expenses in both and when comparing our non gaap results to our non gaap results we exclude these nonrecurring expenses and that is how we evaluate our performance third as a result of ogio travismathew and jack wolfskin acquisition we incurred some noncash purchase accounting adjustments in and when discussing our non gaap results today we exclude these noncash adjustments that as how we evaluate our performance fourth following the jack wolfskin acquisition we reevaluated our segment reporting and changed our operating segments to the first segment being golf equipment which includes golf clubs and golf balls and the second segment is apparel gear and other which includes callaway golf travismathew ogio and jack wolfskin apparel golf and lifestyle bags golf accessories footwear and other gear and accessories as well as royalties from the licensing of soft goods on a product category basis we will break out net sales for golf clothes golf balls apparel and then the remaining gear accessories on a regional basis we will continue to break out the us japan and europe but due to size we have consolidated rest of asia and rest of world into simply rest of world fifth this is to remind you that for consistency with other comparable companies our adjusted ebitda now excludes noncash stock compensation expense in addition to the acquisition related costs with those factors in mind i will now provide some specific financial results turning now to slide today we are reporting consolidated first quarter of net sales of million compared to million in an increase of million or and a record for net sales changes in foreign currency rates negatively impacted first quarter net sales by million on a constant currency basis and excluding the jack wolfskin business first quarter of net sales increased this increase in constant currency core net sales is driven by increased sales in all operating segments in all major product categories and in all major regions including double digit growth in the travismathew business as you can see on slide gross margin was in the first quarter of compared to in the first quarter of which was slightly better than plan excluding non cash purchase accounting adjustments related to the jack wolfskin acquisition and a basis point negative impact of changes in foreign currency gross margins was a basis points decrease compared to the first quarter of this decrease was primarily attributable to the seasonality of the jack wolfskin business as well as the current year mix of higher priced products which typically have lower gross margins due to more advanced technology partially offset by the travismathew business which is accretive on a gross margin basis operating expense was million in the first quarter of which is a million increase compared to million in the first quarter of that includes the first quarter operating expenses related to the new jack wolfskin business excluding one time costs related to the jack wolfskin acquisition operating expenses were million an increase of million in the quarter this increase was primarily due to the addition in of operating expenses from the jack wolfskin business and continued investments in the travismathew business and the golf equipment business operating income was million in the first quarter of compared to operating income of million for the same period in a decrease of when excluding the non recurring jack wolfskin transaction and transition related expenses and non cash purchase accounting adjustments non gaap operating income for was million compared to non gaap operating income of million in a decrease of million or which is predominantly related to the change in foreign currency rates other expense was million in the first quarter of compared to other expense of million in the same period of the prior year when excluding the non recurring purchase price hedging losses due to the jack wolfskin acquisitions other expense was million in the first quarter of an increase of million compared to the first quarter of the higher other expense in resulted primarily from million in interest expense related to the new term loan entered into in january to fund the purchase of jack wolfskin it's partially offset by foreign exchange hedging gains fully diluted earnings per share was or million shares in the first quarter of compared to in the first quarter of excluding the non cash purchase accounting adjustments related to the jack wolfskin ogio and travismathew acquisition and the non recurring transaction and transition expenses related to the jack wolfskin transaction in non gaap fully diluted earnings per share was versus non gaap fully diluted earnings per share of in the first quarter of adjusted ebitda increased to million in the first quarter of increase compared to million in the first quarter of we are particularly pleased with this result given the adverse headwinds from changes in foreign currency turning now to slide i will now cover certain key balance sheet and cash flow items available liquidity which represents additional availability under our credit facilities plus cash on hand was million at the end of the first quarter of compared to million at the end of the first quarter of we have million of principal outstanding under our term loan b facility that was used to purchase the jack wolfskin transaction we have also entered into a cross currency swap agreement with regard to a portion of this facility associated approximately million of this facility effectively now has a fixed interest rate of our consolidated net accounts receivable for million an increase of compared to million at the end of the first quarter of which is attributable to the addition of the jack wolfskin business in days sales outstanding in the core business is generally consistent with the same period in we remain comfortable with the overall quality of our accounts receivable at this time also displayed on slide our inventory balance increased by to million at the end of the first quarter of this increase was primarily due to the addition of the jack wolfskin business an increase in in transit inventory and additional inventory needed to support an overall larger core business in we remain comfortable with the quality of our inventory at this time capital expenditures for the first quarter of were million a year over year increase of million compared to the first quarter of due mainly to continued investments in our ball plant depreciation and amortization expense was million for the first quarter of compared to million in the first quarter of finally including both open market repurchases and shares acquired through the settlement of equity awards in the first quarter of we repurchased million shares for approximately million as compared to the first quarter of when we repurchased million shares for approximately million we currently have million remaining under our current stock repurchase authorization i'll now comment on our guidance which begins with slide i'd like to note that the non gaap guidance we are providing excludes the non cash purchase accounting adjustments for jack wolfskin as well as ogio and travismathew as well as the non recurring transaction and transition expenses related to the jack wolfskin transaction as seen on slide we are reiterating our net sales range of billion to billion an increase of to over due to softer market conditions in central europe and china were approximately of jack wolfskin set sales originates and the concomitant decrease in pre book sales for the upcoming fallwinter season we now expect that jack wolfskin's full year net sales will be to lower than previously anticipated or to lower on a constant currency basis given the strong first quarter growth in the company's other golf equipment apparel and accessories businesses we anticipate that growth in those other businesses will offset the anticipated lower jack wolfskin business these estimates assume changes in foreign currency exchange rates in while a negative impact of million on full year net sales compared to we reiterate our previous guidance for full year gross margins of which is basis higher than further headwinds due to foreign currency exchange rates are expected to be all set by continued improvements in operating the performance we reiterate our previous guidance for full year operating expenses of million we are increasing our non gaap earnings per share guidance to to compared to previous guidance of to this increase is being driven by lower interest costs and a lower effective tax rate which is estimated to be in figures are based on million shares outstanding consistent with our previous guidance we estimate our capital expenditures in to be approximately million to million which includes incremental capital expenditures related to the jack wolfskin business capital expenditures were million in depreciation and amortization expense is estimated to be approximately million in which includes million from the jack wolfskin business da expense for was million we are reiterating our previous adjusted ebitda guidance of million to million an increase in adjusted ebitda on the core golf equipment apparel and accessories business is expected to cover the negative impact of foreign currency exchanges and the expected decrease in adjusted ebitda for the jack wolfskin business we now expect the adjusted ebitda contribution of the jack wolfskin business to be million to million compared to prior guidance of million the decrease which is all in the second half of is due to software market conditions in central europe and china which is impacting the fallwinter pre book orders as well as a little foreign currency impact we estimate that the non cash stock compensation expense will be approximately million in also on slide we're refining our first half net sales guidance to million to million which would represent a to increase compared to the new guidance reflects an increase in the core equipment apparel and accessories businesses offset by an estimated negative impact of million related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates when compared to the same period in it also reflects the shift in the timing of some sales from the second quarter into the first quarter of we are increasing our first half non gap earnings per share guidance to to an increase of to compared to previous guidance which is driven by net sales increases in the core golf equipment apparel and accessories businesses and lower estimated tax rates and hedging gains recorded in the first quarter we are increasing our first half adjusted ebitda guidance to million to million for the first half of compared to the prior guidance of million to million the increase is driven by net sales increases in the core golf equipment apparel and accessories businesses and hedging gains recorded in the first quarter keep in mind this adjusted ebitda guidance excludes non cash stock compensation expense as well as purchase accounting adjustments and non recurring transaction and transition expenses related to the jack wolfskin acquisition as discussed last quarter the decrease in the estimated earnings and adjusted ebitda for the first half of compared to the same period in the prior year reflects the intra year timing of the company's earnings in compared to in a greater portion of the earnings are anticipated to occur in the second half of the year as compared to due to the seasonality of the jack wolfskin business which generally results in operating loss in the first half more golf equipment new product launches in the second half of and less in the second quarter of compared to the same periods in the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the first half of compared to with the first half being adversely affected by an estimated million as well as the timing of the incremental investments in which are weighted more heavily towards the first half conversely for the same reasons during the second half of the company anticipates increased probability compared to second half of all things considered we are pleased with our first quarter results and the performance of our golf equipment and soft goods businesses we also remain excited about the long term prospects of our jack wolfskin business including the strategic benefits it provides and the opportunities it presents for growth and for shareholder value creation over the long term that concludes our prepared remarks today we will now open the call for questions operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of steven zaccone from jp morgan your line is open great thanks very much so first question i have was just on the golf business so with the new reporting segments we don't have the details on woods irons and putters performance so can you just comment on which categories within the club segments saw growth in the first quarter and maybe how do you see the broader competitive backdrop in the clubs thus far this year and then i just have a follow up steven this is chip we had a very good quarter on the putter category and i believe we also had a good quarter on irons correct and obviously the categories overall if you look at our competitive performance in the marketplace we're showing really strong performance across the breadth of our line up right now so we'd like the position we're in throughout the entire club portfolio okay great and then just on jack wolfskin so can you elaborate a little bit more on what you're seeing that's resulting in the guidance cut for revenue and ebitda is the weakness in bookings equally spread between europe and china or is it more weighted toward one region and along those same lines we're still pretty early in the year here so what gives you confidence the new guidance is an achievable level for the year sure so the jack wolfskin let me answer the last part of that question first so the apparel businesses operates differently than our traditional equipment business and that it works on longer pre book lead times so we have pre books now for the fallwinter season which is the shipments in q and early q of the year those all came in basically during q and so that's a level of visibility that we don't have in our traditional core business what we saw all over in europe primarily but also in china a couple of different factors one was a general slowing of the economies over there which i think have been well documented and secondly and a probably more cute issue right now is that the weather didn't cooperate the fallwinter period is their largest period and if they had a warm probably winter if you would that was also followed by last summer which was a very warm dry period for them and so that backed up sales in the channel and led to lower pre books which we are hearing is really a bit of an industry wide issue the wholesale channel in general is putting in less pre books and so we have pretty strong visibility now of our pre books through the balance of the year and it gives us improved visibility and improved confidence relative to those numbers did that any answer your question steven on the jack wolfskin yes that's helpful thank you okay and your next question comes from the line of dave king from roth capital your line is open thanks afternoon guys i guess first on the equipment margins look like those were down a fair bit year on year was that mainly involves or what are some of the puts and takes there was erc soft accretive or dilutive and then i guess more importantly what sort of recovery are you expecting in q and beyond thanks chip it's dave it's chip and our ball margins were relatively flat year over year as we've discussed in the past that ball plant in chicopee is going through a transformation process it's pretty significant and so we do continue to see improvement in that business and we're optimistic on that going forward obviously the brand has momentum in the marketplace as well the club margins were down in q on a year over year basis the majority of that comes out of the gross margin there was some profitability impact as well on the operating expense side the operating expenses is just strictly timing the margin is an issue that we always see on this particular cycle and we're launching our most premium products the epic flash driver and the apex irons have higher average selling prices but also higher costs and as a result the gross margin percentages are lower so that was an expected outcome for us if you look at our projections for the full year you see that our gross margins are going to be up on a year over year basis and that's despite fx headwinds okay that's good color there so thank you and then on jack wolfskin of the million in ebitda you reported how much did that contribute to that number in q was it breakeven like you expected the was revenue dave so and no but then sorry the million of ebitda for the overall company that you reported i think in q got it dave jack was actually slightly profitable from an ebitda perspective in q so pretty close to our expectations okay and then one last quick one in terms of the jack wolfskin i think last year when all was set and done it contributed or they booked million of revenue i think it was in the pro forma so in your outlook for million call it at the midpoint are the booking was down kind of the high single digits as well is that the right way to be thinking about it the pre book yes dave the million was at the last year's average euro so but if you would moved back to the it would have translated those sales into ish million so the down here is is part currency and obviously part the q pre books yes so we're expecting the revenues at jack wolfskin to be on a euro basis or a constant currency basis down to so i relevant down to adjust our guidance but in context to not alarming from our perspective understood so it sounds like the bookings are down kind of to is that the right way to be thinking about that yes we're not going to break out the bookings but our for you as it relates but we factored our bookings into the revenue estimates all right fair enough i thought i'd try all right thanks guys no problem your next question comes from the line of brett andress from keybanc capital your line is open hi good afternoon hi brett hi so building off some of the questions about the pre bookings i guess just to better understand this do softer pre bookings historically represent loss sales or is there the potential that should the conditions improve in these markets you could eventually get those sales back at some point this year they do usually lead to golf sales so you can obviously make up a portion of that in at once business and there is also a significant portion of the jack wolfskin business that's a direct to consumer business both through e com and our own retail but the wholesale is the largest portion of that business and the pre bookings are strong indicator it also gives us more confidence than we would in our core business in the quality of the forecast got it thank you for that clarification and then chip can you elaborate a little bit more on how the golf industry i guess both here in the us and internationally played out in the first quarter versus your expectations and at least at some of the datatech data we look at there some share losses in the first quarter for you guys here in us how much of that was expected when do you expect to start recouping share just can you elaborate on the golf industry i guess in general yes sure so the golf industry is in a healthy position overall the i call it flat for the first quarter on a global basis it was down a little bit in asia it was up a little bit in europe and it was flat here in north america is my estimate weather wasn't as cooperative as we'd like it to have been year to date but the industry is still quite healthy and we're within with lower part of our range but within the range of what we would have expected so we said flat up for the market we are flat and candidly we're fine with that we think that the industry is in a good position and we like our position in that the share you are correct if you look at our market shares in the us we were down in the first quarter we had a very tough comp on a share basis in the first quarter so our shares last year were quite high our shares now in the channels that they report into datatech have declined a little bit but we're still in a very strong position we are number one in all clubs number one in woods number one in drivers number one in fairway wood number one in hybrids number one in irons number one in putters and the epic flash driver was the number one selling model so i'm not all together too disappointed in our position and i think our brand strength is pretty evident there in a healthy market and candidly the core business as you pour through our numbers it is performing very strongly and showing continued momentum year after year great and then last one just a housekeeping i guess the apparel segment i think you guys reported million of revenue jack wolfskin did million and i'm assuming travismathew was greater than million so does the jack wolfskin business fall into other segments i'm trying to understand this new reclassification yes they have a portion in apparel as well as gear and other they have footwear they have tents they have a whole host of other products so it's not just the apparel and brett travis continues to do it's growing in that double digits that brian had referred to in his comments awesome thank you guys thank you your next question comes from the line of michael swartz from suntrust robinson humphrey your line is open hey guys good evening i just wanted a point of clarification understanding you're taking down your expectations for jack wolfskin in but i think at the time of the acquisition you laid out some medium to longer term goals i think it was million or so in revenue it was about million in ebitda i just wanted to confirm are those targets still achievable are they still what you're kind of aiming for no change in the long term outlook mike okay great and then just next question and kind of piggybacking on one of brett's questions was it looks like you're looking for organic growth and kind of the to range in i think you said your expectations for the market are flat to up to so i would assume that plus that you're looking from callaway i mean how much should we think about that is being share versus unit volume or pricing i think that our correct me if i'm wrong but i think our projections in the quarter are even on the little higher than what you just articulated correct currency neutral is couple of points higher than that currency impacted were okay fair enough and then we really don't project share so i don't really have a estimate for you i do think we'll be stronger on a share basis in the second half of the year but we also believe our revenues are going to be strong in the second half of the year and so it's a little more difficult to give you i basically can't give you an estimate about how much of share versus the others at this point we do see average selling prices have been going up for us we're in a cycle that supports that and we are being successful with the products that we have at the prices they are in the marketplace currently okay great and one final question also kind of clarification on the guidance i think you're saying now that currency is going to be a million headwind i think prior you said million all right are you including jack wolfskin in the year over year currency negative in both of those i'm just trying to parse out was is currency really almost million is worse than it was two months ago there was probably million related to jack wolfskin in the first quarter we had not previously included when we gave the guidance last time but the balance would be increased currency okay wonderful thank you thank you your next question comes from the line of daniel imbro from stephens your line is open yes hey thanks good afternoon guys good afternoon chip wanted to start on some of the long term synergy targets you just talked about i think in your prepared remarks you noted you guys have identified some additional synergies between existing soft goods in the jack wolfskin asset one can you just provide some more detail on what those look like and then two are any of those now included in your updated guidance for the back half of the year the nature of the synergies really come from three areas right now and we're really only talking about cost base synergies there are some others that are clearly we think we're going to be able to help them grow at certain markets and they will be able to help us and others but it's supply chain across our apparel and soft goods business it's logistics across those business and distribution centers and as we're diving into this and obviously been a lot of learning over the last several months we are literally drinking from the fire hose and getting a lot of good information we've become not only more confident but we've found some areas we think there are increased synergies as we will get this none of those are factored into most of those won't really even materialize till late and kind of scaling up from there in fact we're investing right now so now that is in our guidance but this is a period of incremental investment and building for the future but that has been our practice over the last several years and the so far it appears to be paying off well for shareholders with the growth of the business and such definitely thanks that's helpful and then brian one on gross margin adjusting out some of the purchase accounting still some heavier pressure in q i know some of that was seasonality but could you just shed some more light on what the different buckets the pressure where and then which of those is expected to improve to get to that full year guided target of sure i think you start with last year we had this year there's probably basis points related to the one timers related to the inventory step up and things like that there was basis points related to fx so if you back all that out it's only down basis points some of that seasonality of the jack wolfskin business they're less profitable in the first half than they are on the second half and then also has to do the cyclicality as chip mentioned earlier of our products this year versus with the higher price products and having more technology just lower margin percent that's all and then we have offset their travismathew which is accretive to gross margins and then daniel remember because we're launching more products in the second half you're going to have margin opportunity as your percent of new business is higher got it and we shouldn't expect headwinds like you guys called out from higher product costs on the new launches like we saw this quarter well we'll see it being higher than the margin we had last year but we're not commenting at this point the nature of those new product launches if you would got it thanks so much guys best of luck yes thank you your next question comes from the line of john kernan from cowen and company your line is open good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions sure can you just talk again to the gross margin conference in the back half of the year it is a bit of an inflection i know there is obvious seasonality with the jack wolfskin business but it doesn't apply a pretty big inflection based on where you're walking us through the for the first half of the year are you at all concerned given some of the pre booking weakness about gross margin in the jack wolfskin business thank you just overall i mean we think we're very comfortable with the gross margin estimates in the golf you just have to remember also that we have a lot of new product launches coming in the second half which we did it and those are typically much better margins than just continue selling so i think overall we're pretty comfortable anything else yes and we do continue to believe that the ball margins will continue to improve as we get more experienced in that plan so some of that is helping but i think to brian's point it's mostly related to the launches in the second half which from a mixed perspective it is helping a good chunk that's helpful that actually lead into my second question just on the golf ball state of golf ball profitability right now versus where you think it can go long term i know triple track and our indiscernible had a lot of share gain and you've invested a lot in the manufacturing part of the business i'm just wondering where those golf ball margins lying now versus where you think they can go in in the medium to near term the golf ball we're still in a learning curve so we will be for the next year quite frankly in terms of the investments we're making in chicopee and the efficiencies of that facility so we are paying a short term penalty in terms of the profitability of that business and it's still very profitable we're very pleased with it but we've got some upside potential in that facility as we finish up the transformation process and if we're able to continue to build volume and come up the learning curves which we're demonstrating the ability to do on the facility then it should be a growth opportunity for us or improvement opportunity and eventually the accretive to overall business it is very close to neutral right now quite frankly but as we move further down the road it'll probably be accretive in terms of the overall profitability and gross margin got it and then just one final thematic question about the sport of golf feels like there's momentum tiger winning the masters and obviously a big deal there's a lot of good young players excitement building for the pga here in new york coming up just wondering where you think we are at in the industry you had kind of flat for the first quarter where are we in the overall cycle for golf in an overall consumer interest i think it's improving i think your metrics are very clear the fact that we are a flat as an industry even the rounds were down it's a pretty good performance we didn't have average weather we never know when you're going through or not but it wasn't as well as good as we expect your right tiger woods is very good for the game there are a lot of young players out there the national golf foundation reported for the first time a long time increased participation and interest get these noncore golf opportunities such as topgolf and other segments that are really growing interest in availability in the game so it's in a healthy spot right now excellent thanks guys and congrats on all the momentum in callaway thank you thanks your next question comes from the line of susan anderson from b riley fbr your line is open hi good evening congrats on the quarter just a follow up on the jack wolfskin business did you guys break out the gear accessories versus apparel for the business on what percent we do not susan best of my knowledge but the majority of the business is apparel and gear and other is indiscernible gear and other got it okay that's helpful and then i guess i was kind of curious on how you're managing inventory for that business i guess you are making products so you have sales down two to three given the orders or are you making more maybe anticipation that self could come in better than expected or how should we think about that go ahead brian in the wholesale got it okay and then last one on jack wolfskin i guess are you guys expecting your dtc business to also to be down at similar amount this fall winter and then i guess where the lighter orders both in bags and accessories and then also apparel susan we don't have it we're not going to break out the estimates by channel for jack wolfskin but at this point i would assume it's premature estimate it i wouldn't be expecting to lower the forecast for direct to consumer based on what happened a year ago winter the wholesale channel has no choice because of their inventory positions and open devices et cetera that is absolutely an industry wide phenomenon but the nice part of our direct to consumer is it's going to be what it's going to be at that point okay and then i guess maybe you could talk a little bit about just the health of industry across the geographies i mean it sounds like it's obviously still very healthy in the us how are you feeling in europe with some macro pressure there and then also over in asia asia we got off to a little bit of a slower start to the year in japan specifically but that has been improving so the trend is good but they're down that market in general this year our business though has been strong there and continues to perform very well and we do like the trend europe in the golf business had a very good start to the year which means the weather was warm which means that the jack wolfskin business was challenged from that same weather perspective so we are naturally hedged in europe now on weather but that business in the market is positive and the market in the us got off to we'll call it a slow start in q roughly flat and has improved a little bit since then but not anything outside of the trends that we're expecting great that's very helpful thanks so much good luck next quarter thank you your next question comes from the line of randy konik from jefferies your line is open yes thanks thanks a lot i guess you wanted to start with the success of travismathew continue to talk about double digit growth the lifestyle of the brand seems to be wider and it gets a wider indiscernible in terms of demand consumers that want to buy the brand how do you guys think about your learnings from the couple of stores you have opened a few stores you have opened now your alternative points of wholesale distribution when should we see international development accelerate just kind of curious on your thoughts around what's ahead of the next couple of years for travismathew to begin here okay randy you're right the brand is really resonating and it's resonating outside of traditional golf so it's very golf brand is golf dna but it's a lifestyle brand its largest customers are outside of golf and it is worn on the golf courts but also off golf courts and we really find that is an attractive element of that brand because of the broader reach and scale potential with that we're not really looking for greater wholesale distribution on that we're going to be pretty measured on that we've got good momentum in that brand and we want to control that process of growth we are investing in the brand internationally and we're in the middle of a starting up some efforts on that both in asia specifically japan as well as europe those are very small revenue numbers in this year's forecast but there are revenues associated with it and efforts and we do believe that over time that will scale it'll scale relative to the size of the travismathew business but it is a nice added element to our total business great and on jack wolfskin i think two things you said in the past one there's plans to expand the business or the brand in north america just curious on how you're thinking about time lining that and i think you also said in the past that the business will be run kind of independently but one area will be where that brand or that business can leverage your core strength is in the digital side of community communities you build across things like the ship show or callaway live with callaway or life on tour with travismathew so just kind of curious of how you're thinking about keeping the business i guess separately run but also you're bringing kind of expertise or things that you've done really really well around this particularly around digital marketing and community building with digital means with callaway and travismathew just curious how you're thinking about that for jack wolfskin yes i think randy you've come with some very good points there they're not lost on us so the jack wolfskin north america business we anticipate that will launch here in north america sometime between early q and q of next year so we're still dialing in the specifics of that but it should in the ballpark of mid next year we're putting the organization together on plans on that currently we expect it to leverage some of the synergies that we have here in the us both with the travismathew brand and parallel positions back office infrastructure we expect it to leverage off of our digital and brand building expertise associated with the callaway golf and we're sharing some resources from that perspective we don't anticipate to what i call co brand if you look at how we operate these brands travismathew and callaway are operated separately even though there are some synergies that are invisible to the consumer and we think that will certainly be the case with the jack wolfskin brand and we're putting our plans in place now to launch that for us next year great and i guess last question when you came out with the epic flash and the marketing campaign talked about the use of ai and the algorithm so forth how the customer respond to that marketing messaging and more importantly the product seems like it was well received is this kind of process that you use for this particular driver how do you think about particularly using that in other product development cycles or other product categories going forward what is the development of epic flesh taught you about utilization of ai in other areas of business well epic flash is the number one selling model driver in golf so it appears to have resonated nicely with the consumers we think that the reason it does is this based on the performance of the product and the added ball speed that our technology delivers ai is a key technology for us and candidly for anybody else in the design space if you're not using that type of an approach pretty soon i think you're going to have a hard time keeping up candidly we're learning a lot we're starting to learn how to apply it in other areas of the business in terms of products broader than just the face technology and i think that you're going to see that technology others will be following it i'm sure i believe within the space we have the first move advantage and i believe it's going to be something that we're going to continue to mind and understand and we will see it impact our product line and our technologies in broad way going forward very helpful thanks guys thank you thanks randy your next question comes from the line of alex maroccia from berenberg capital markets your line is open hey guys good afternoon just to expand on one of the prior questions in regards to jack wolfskin's distribution going forward it looks like there's been some expansion upon the retailers in the us where the brand is currently sold are you seeing any type of early poster there and how that's resonating with consumers alex i'm not really familiar with that in the us at this point we have not really leaned in on the us business at this point if there is expanded distribution in the us for jack wolfskin it has not hit my radar screen yet we appreciate the support that we must have received but it's still very very small there's been no marketing we have not had the opportunity to lean in that they've always had a little bit of a presence here that i think they have one employee and a few independent agents it's been a very very small presence and remains that but it wouldn't surprise me if just the fact that we acquired them and jack wolfskin is probably getting a little bit more peak hour now and retailers establishing a partnership they probably know we're going to be coming with some energy in the near future so glad to hear somewhere we are jumping on board okay got it that's helpful and then one more switching to golf ball specifically you alluded to this earlier but it looks like the rounds played data came in pretty poor in q and most importantly in sungolf and as a result where exactly are you seeing the strong growth involved is it in market share is it within the new products that you've released yes our market share overall so it's within chrome soft and it's within erc but our lineup across the board has candidly met or exceeded expectations throughout the quarter particularly our biggest launch was the erc with triple track technology that triple track technology is clearly resonating with consumers as is that new erc golf ball which we're very excited about and our chrome soft business remains very strong as well really across channels so delighted with the overall view of our golf ball business okay great thank you for taking my question sure your next question comes from the line of casey alexander from compass point your line is open yes hi good afternoon most of the questions have been asked and answered but i will ask most of the time when there's a technological change like artificial intelligence that takes place in the golf club equipment business there's a competitor set that simply can't afford to access those types of resources is that possible in the future of the industry as you look forward the next few years it will be a little harder casey it's not like the supercomputer itself is that expensive the supercomputer itself is not going to keep any significant it'd be hard if you're working out of your garage but that's not really what we're facing anymore it's the quality of the engineering and support staff it's the integration with it designing your own software that integrates with other software packages both open market and some that we have to create ourselves the finite element analysis and predictive work that has to go into creating the algorithms it is an example of item that could lead to further consolidation and helps to have good scale yes okay and secondly you're still generating a lot of cash flow here how do you think about debt repayment versus share repurchase going forward and at what point in time can you actually start to pay down on the term debt we hope we are generating what we think is positive free cash flow we're finding good attractive investment opportunities as you saw we repurchase some shares during the first quarter and as we look at our uses of free cash flow and capital we're certainly going to take a strong look at some debt repayment through the balance of the year as well okay great thanks very much thanks casey thanks casey and your next question comes from the line of brett andress from keybanc capital your line is open just a follow up are we going to get the historical segment reclassification results for quarterly at some point yes we can give you the future quarter's obviously q has been restated but yes we will send that out to you guys alright thank you thank you there are no further questions at this time i'll turn the call back over to chip brewer for some closing remarks well thanks everybody for calling in we went a little over so appreciate your patience on that but we wanted to answer the questions that were in the queue thanks for your time attention we'll look forward to talking to you again at the end of q this concludes today's conference call you may now disconnect
