-0.89802337	you're seeing that's resulting	-0.014741452
-1.1475905	in the guidance cut	-0.014741452
-1.3048558	ebitda is the weakness	-0.014741452
-0.7106254	the pre booking weakness	-0.014741452
-1.265417	sounds like the bookings	-0.014741452
-1.5101409	break out the bookings	-0.014741452
-0.9329367	we factored our bookings	-0.014741452
-0.93617	the weakness in bookings	-0.014741452
-0.61626244	and the pre bookings	-0.014741452
-0.61626244	about the pre bookings	-0.014741452
-0.76635975	do softer pre bookings	-0.014741452
-0.8605894	weakness in bookings equally	-0.014741452
-0.5620996	in bookings equally spread	-0.014741452
-0.561901	bookings equally spread between	-0.014741452
-0.84848756	some additional synergies between	-0.014741452
-0.561901	north america sometime between	-0.014741452
-0.7107957	it more weighted toward	-0.014741452
-0.9366049	one region and along	-0.014741452
-0.84878486	along those same lines	-0.014741452
-1.3294057	the industry is still	-0.014741452
-1.0504181	the purchase accounting still	-0.014741452
-0.89496	bit but we're still	-0.014741452
-0.89496	year so we're still	-0.014741452
-0.78231233	golf ball we're still	-0.014741452
-0.78231233	same lines we're still	-0.014741452
-1.0505731	business and it's still	-0.014741452
-1.0505731	received but it's still	-0.014741452
-0.8673567	like it's obviously still	-0.014741452
-0.90444833	and secondly you're still	-0.014741452
-0.89864653	achievable are they still	-0.014741452
-0.7091062	are those targets still	-0.014741452
-1.0981231	brand strength is pretty	-0.014741452
-1.8728901	going to be pretty	-0.014741452
-1.1435957	down it's a pretty	-0.014741452
-0.9131654	doesn't apply a pretty	-0.014741452
-1.1052706	data came in pretty	-0.014741452
-1.5418568	so we have pretty	-0.014741452
-0.92256325	think overall we're pretty	-0.014741452
-0.92539793	in q so pretty	-0.014741452
-0.9167585	transformation process it's pretty	-0.014741452
-1.1354897	lines we're still pretty	-0.014741452
-0.5604992	of an approach pretty	-0.014741452
-1.535199	in q and early	-0.014741452
-1.1822599	any type of early	-0.014741452
-0.77368224	america sometime between early	-0.014741452
-0.8865209	we're still pretty early	-0.014741452
-1.2430645	year and it gives	-0.014741452
-1.0786349	indicator it also gives	-0.014741452
-0.90789646	here so what gives	-0.014741452
-0.93150204	what gives you confidence	-0.014741452
-0.9118819	gives us more confidence	-0.014741452
-0.77400905	visibility and improved confidence	-0.014741452
-1.2095174	guidance is an achievable	-0.014741452
-0.8823443	those targets still achievable	-0.014741452
-1.1033453	so that's a level	-0.014741452
-0.7106254	is an achievable level	-0.014741452
-2.3103542	the jack wolfskin let	-0.014741452
-1.2265724	we wanted to answer	-0.014741452
-0.8325684	wolfskin let me answer	-0.014741452
-0.80961394	did that any answer	-0.014741452
-0.8605894	the apparel businesses operates	-0.014741452
-0.5620996	apparel businesses operates differently	-0.014741452
-1.1829481	resonating outside of traditional	-0.014741452
-1.2840159	have in our traditional	-0.014741452
-0.91569805	differently than our traditional	-0.014741452
-0.9303734	and that it works	-0.014741452
-1.1061654	some medium to longer	-0.014741452
-0.9322106	it works on longer	-0.014741452
-1.3053206	which is the shipments	-0.014741452
-0.93150204	question when you came	-0.014741452
-0.9141182	year those all came	-0.014741452
-0.71051604	rounds played data came	-0.014741452
-1.0960187	give you i basically	-0.014741452
-1.1077142	all came in basically	-0.014741452
-0.935772	a level of visibility	-0.014741452
-0.90243846	have pretty strong visibility	-0.014741452
-0.77400905	gives us improved visibility	-0.014741452
-0.9320506	currency neutral is couple	-0.014741452
-1.2926161	learnings from the couple	-0.014741452
-0.933053	in china a couple	-0.014741452
-1.0827184	of the next couple	-0.014741452
-0.93717986	on what the different	-0.014741452
-1.2266783	a couple of different	-0.014741452
-1.178804	one was a general	-0.014741452
-1.160425	that market in general	-0.014741452
-0.9196047	wholesale channel in general	-0.014741452
-0.9196047	i guess in general	-0.014741452
-0.8099654	was a general slowing	-0.014741452
-1.3837092	slowing of the economies	-0.014741452
-0.35902873	that and i think	-0.014741452
-0.35902873	technology and i think	-0.014741452
-0.35902873	position and i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	you reported i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	range in i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	here that i think	-0.014741452
-0.40282542	jack wolfskin i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	the guidance i think	-0.014741452
-0.4388546	of sure i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	apparel segment i think	-0.014741452
-0.27523726	in but i think	-0.014741452
-0.27523726	wrong but i think	-0.014741452
-0.27523726	helping but i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	there which i think	-0.014741452
-0.46195537	selling so i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	of revenue i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	talked about i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	million headwind i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	consumer interest i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	wolfskin yes i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	term goals i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	or pricing i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	it's improving i think	-0.014741452
-0.3960417	pretty soon i think	-0.014741452
-0.4519956	versus where you think	-0.014741452
-0.4519956	wondering where you think	-0.014741452
-1.0142846	how do you think	-0.1594372
-1.0880538	consumer and we think	-0.014741452
-1.1406639	with that we think	-0.014741452
-0.98140275	generating what we think	-0.014741452
-0.5575666	how should we think	-0.014741452
-0.5575666	much should we think	-0.014741452
-0.8106155	i mean we think	-0.014741452
-0.8106155	some areas we think	-0.014741452
-0.8106155	are clearly we think	-0.014741452
-0.8106155	the consumers we think	-0.014741452
-0.89923704	you i do think	-0.014741452
-1.2380584	do you guys think	-0.014741452
-0.90479726	have been well documented	-0.014741452
-1.244019	yes okay and secondly	-0.014741452
-0.92832917	well documented and secondly	-0.014741452
-0.9310195	jack wolfskin is probably	-0.014741452
-1.2471912	secondly and a probably	-0.014741452
-1.2056228	ago there was probably	-0.014741452
-0.89897525	a partnership they probably	-0.014741452
-0.7727034	had a warm probably	-0.014741452
-0.8680943	this year there's probably	-0.014741452
-0.7093878	the road it'll probably	-0.014741452
-0.9123041	a probably more cute	-0.014741452
-1.2092743	margin is an issue	-0.014741452
-0.561901	probably more cute issue	-0.014741452
-0.862455	an industry wide issue	-0.014741452
-1.6667695	is that the weather	-0.014741452
-0.93099904	which means the weather	-0.014741452
-1.1005911	europe now on weather	-0.014741452
-0.8476254	from that same weather	-0.014741452
-0.8476254	is my estimate weather	-0.014741452
-0.80912423	didn't have average weather	-0.014741452
-1.105162	good performance we didn't	-0.014741452
-0.98292285	that the weather didn't	-0.014741452
-0.7107957	the weather didn't cooperate	-0.014741452
-0.9323948	fallwinter period is their	-0.014741452
-1.1066643	choice because of their	-0.014741452
-0.80973315	we have offset their	-0.014741452
-1.3045574	wholesale is the largest	-0.014741452
-0.8324679	lifestyle brand its largest	-0.014741452
-0.77400905	period is their largest	-0.014741452
-0.9330309	certain markets and they	-0.014741452
-0.9269218	still achievable are they	-0.014741452
-0.93082696	the channels that they	-0.014741452
-1.2487586	point this year they	-0.014741452
-0.90505624	first half than they	-0.014741452
-0.9102372	it contributed or they	-0.014741452
-1.4978745	gear and other they	-0.014741452
-0.7074204	they have footwear they	-0.014741452
-1.051564	period and if they	-0.014741452
-1.1867454	that i think they	-0.014741452
-1.2247816	where you think they	-0.014741452
-0.8977293	new reclassification yes they	-0.014741452
-0.77042806	at the prices they	-0.014741452
-0.55970025	they have tents they	-0.014741452
-0.55970025	establishing a partnership they	-0.014741452
-1.2978742	they had a warm	-0.014741452
-0.9265672	the weather was warm	-0.014741452
-1.210975	was a very warm	-0.014741452
-0.9170853	that was also followed	-0.014741452
-0.897999	followed by last summer	-0.014741452
-0.77433276	a very warm dry	-0.014741452
-0.9314107	dry period for them	-0.014741452
-0.71051604	that we acquired them	-0.014741452
-0.862455	able to help them	-0.014741452
-1.1050787	and so that backed	-0.014741452
-1.6772817	sales in the channel	-0.014741452
-0.90627205	the estimates by channel	-0.014741452

-0.5620996	even materialize till late	-0.014741452
-1.7034327	and kind of scaling	-0.014741452
-1.2186987	if just the fact	-0.014741452
-0.9317777	very clear the fact	-0.014741452
-1.1077142	from there in fact	-0.014741452
-1.3585279	growth we are investing	-0.014741452

-0.7407994	at this point i would
-0.6861237	so but if you would
-0.6861237	probably winter if you would
-0.6861237	product launches if you would
-0.8247323	more confidence than we would
-0.99521905	range of what we would
-0.8320459	back to the it would
-1.1130488	million to million which would
-0.83229804	time but the balance would
-0.98409814	this time i would like
-1.2265427	good position and we like

-0.5894564	when do you expect to
-0.7260395	headwinds today we expect to
-0.70301193	entered into in january to
-0.7936955	starting to learn how to
-0.7217892	business to be million to
-0.67326987	ebitda guidance to million to
-0.67326987	sales guidance to million to
-0.7831087	ebitda guidance of million to
-0.82947993	prior guidance of million to
-1.0703095	to be approximately million to
-0.29559824	of which is attributable to
-0.29559824	decrease was primarily attributable to
-0.6168731	travismathew which is accretive to
-0.5269651	and eventually the accretive to
-0.50665516	facility that was used to
-0.50665516	swap agreement with regard to
-0.50665516	and additional inventory needed to
-0.6296648	quarter of due mainly to
-0.6296648	sales range of billion to
-0.3970342	rate which is estimated to
-0.3970342	amortization expense is estimated to
-0.7564733	guys good afternoon just to
-0.7564733	bookings i guess just to
-1.1989548	helping but i think to
-0.29559824	scale it'll scale relative to
-0.29559824	and improved confidence relative to
-0.6980735	constant currency basis down to
-0.6980735	so i relevant down to
-0.7246542	i wouldn't be expecting to
-0.3388442	that currency is going to
-0.20276357	our revenues are going to
-0.20276357	gross margins are going to
-0.30560288	up are we going to
-0.15689802	on that we're going to
-0.15689802	something that we're going to
-0.17974693	we think we're going to
-0.17974693	probably know we're going to
-0.20276357	itself is not going to
-0.17635487	it we're not going to
-0.17635487	yes we're not going to
-0.17974693	consumer is it's going to
-0.17974693	i believe it's going to
-0.17974693	be what it's going to
-0.22092955	think that you're going to
-0.22092955	second half you're going to
-0.22092955	i think you're going to
-0.30560288	capital we're certainly going to
-0.50665516	much did that contribute to
-0.29559824	it is very close to
-0.29559824	q so pretty close to
-0.3453591	that the right way to
-0.50665516	guidance but in context to
-0.3970342	the us got off to
-0.3970342	asia we got off to
-0.832868	to improve to get to
-0.24597135	part of our direct to
-0.24597135	business that's a direct to
-0.24597135	the forecast for direct to
-0.29559824	other segments i'm trying to
-0.29559824	those i'm just trying to
-0.50665516	that brian had referred to
-0.24252269	i guess you wanted to
-0.24252269	good afternoon chip wanted to
-0.24252269	that but we wanted to
-0.28690177	ebitda i just wanted to
-0.29559824	in in the medium to
-0.29559824	laid out some medium to
-0.50665516	a little more difficult to
-0.6296648	look forward to talking to
-0.3084041	golf so it appears to
-0.3084041	so far it appears to
-0.6296648	you just talk again to
-0.50665516	we're demonstrating the ability to
-0.6296648	of the brand seems to
-0.29559824	brand and we want to
-0.29559824	demand consumers that want to
-0.67985594	a nice added element to
-0.67985594	past one there's plans to
-0.50665516	synergies that are invisible to
-0.50665516	how the customer respond to
-0.50665516	prior questions in regards to
-0.50665516	near future so glad to
-0.50665516	then one more switching to
-0.50665516	ball specifically you alluded to

-0.46899292	kind of clarification on the
-0.5183078	good evening congrats on the
-0.46899292	it is worn on the
-0.79365355	at the midpoint are the
-0.45205918	core strength is in the
-0.38953143	gross margin conference in the
-0.38953143	we are at in the
-0.2781223	of compared to in the
-0.38953143	per share of in the
-0.38953143	prices they are in the
-0.38953143	go ahead brian in the
-0.38953143	as we've discussed in the
-0.38953143	accepted accounting principles in the
-0.43020093	can go in in the
-0.38953143	where are we in the
-0.45205918	familiar with that in the
-0.44465017	presentations tab also in the
-0.38953143	our shares now in the
-0.38953143	to be strong in the
-0.54041165	our competitive performance in the
-0.38953143	existing soft goods in the
-0.38953143	questions that were in the
-0.34707785	first quarter growth in the
-0.34707785	double digit growth in the
-0.34707785	segments saw growth in the
-0.41984537	but that business in the
-0.44224316	our core business in the
-0.48945522	reflects an increase in the
-0.39493483	to jack wolfskin in the
-0.39493483	including jack wolfskin in the
-0.43020093	which is all in the
-0.44465017	internationally and we're in the
-0.38953143	invested a lot in the
-0.31264126	and the market in the
-0.31264126	flat golf market in the
-0.24967647	think it was in the
-0.24967647	gross margin was in the
-0.38953143	was approximately flat in the
-0.24967647	our market shares in the
-0.24967647	or million shares in the
-0.4112864	we have here in the
-0.4112864	guess both here in the
-0.38953143	internationally played out in the
-0.38953143	the trend europe in the
-0.38953143	is expanded distribution in the
-0.38953143	think our projections in the
-0.38953143	of and less in the
-0.38953143	still very healthy in the
-0.38953143	our leadership positions in the
-0.46840107	and continued investments in the
-0.31264126	backed up sales in the
-0.31264126	record net sales in the
-0.38953143	but it should in the
-0.23986638	a share basis in the
-0.37145334	increased to million in the
-0.17302877	compared to million in the
-0.37145334	increase of million in the

-0.33806118	income was million in the
-0.47423077	currency exchange rates in the
-0.38953143	about gross margin in the
-0.44465017	quarter the decrease in the
-0.38953143	launching more products in the
-0.5237063	the same period in the
-0.43020093	for no change in the
-0.38953143	some share losses in the
-0.38953143	interest in availability in the
-0.38953143	days sales outstanding in the
-0.38953143	of equity awards in the
-0.38953143	gross margin estimates in the
-0.38953143	reflects the shift in the
-0.23986638	net sales increases in the
-0.23986638	hedging gains recorded in the
-0.38953143	anticipated to occur in the
-0.38953143	in operating loss in the
-0.24967647	to the launches in the
-0.24967647	new product launches in the
-0.38953143	the same periods in the
-0.38953143	broader competitive backdrop in the
-0.38953143	seeing that's resulting in the
-0.38953143	still pretty early in the
-0.45315373	we were down in the
-0.44465017	brand has momentum in the
-0.38953143	they're less profitable in the
-0.24967647	things you said in the
-0.24967647	you also said in the
-0.38953143	we are investing in the
-0.38953143	product launches coming in the
-0.38953143	for anybody else in the
-0.38953143	we're still dialing in the
-0.38953143	that takes place in the
-0.38953143	upon the retailers in the
-0.38953143	with some energy in the
-0.38953143	is that possible in the
-0.66084355	in the us where the
-0.66084355	then i guess where the
-0.9825942	the space we have the
-1.0030894	segments we don't have the
-0.5019009	measures we have reconciled the
-0.40168226	of compared to with the
-0.44356316	building expertise associated with the
-0.40168226	quarter and that with the
-0.44356316	wanted to start with the
-0.40168226	the us both with the

-1.0231768	year over year basis the
-1.026238	balls apparel and then the
-0.67279077	we are providing excludes the
-1.3018192	of million to million the
-1.2787262	prior guidance of million the

-0.6619757	little bit about just the
-0.6619757	so it's not just the
-0.6619757	surprise me if just the
-0.3409189	share is it within the
-0.3409189	on which categories within the
-0.3409189	sure i believe within the
-0.3409189	our range but within the
-0.71350926	irons correct and obviously the
-0.60537285	that going forward obviously the

-0.27549964	deal there's a lot of
-0.27549964	still generating a lot of
-0.5058024	more opportunity in front of
-0.75054526	and rapidly growing segment of
-0.99281186	segment turning to slide of
-0.8013058	where and then which of
-0.7304193	and china were approximately of
-0.5058024	that with the exception of
-0.29482383	shift in the timing of

-0.5058024	portfolio travismathew is worthy of
-0.68276954	of that comes out of
-0.68276954	if you're working out of

-1.0026394	slide of the presentation our
-0.88773793	now that is in our
-0.7347512	we reflected this in our
-0.7347512	than we would in our
-0.7347512	we don't have in our
-0.7347512	to reinvest back in our
-0.9352044	by a growth in our
-0.9001397	business and increase in our
-0.830543	all the brands in our
-0.7347512	turning to slide in our
-0.93383586	to continued investments in our
-0.830543	was not included in our
-0.7347512	together too disappointed in our
-0.6850818	that in connection with our
-0.5624875	we are pleased with our
-0.5624875	mentioned we're pleased with our
-0.6850818	our club lineup with our
-0.6850818	have been targeting with our
-0.76944256	shares outstanding consistent with our
-0.9149078	year you see that our
-1.0741781	pricing i think that our
-0.80106515	added ball speed that our
-0.80906963	to not alarming from our
-1.0390971	are on track for our
-0.7860796	expected market conditions for our
-0.7860796	establishing organizational infrastructure for our
-0.3366456	have million remaining under our
-0.3366456	represents additional availability under our
-0.3366456	of principal outstanding under our
-0.7832543	as you pour through our
-1.0334122	in general this year our
-0.38418117	great testament to both our
-0.38418117	convergence related to both our
-0.7053335	good performance in both our
-0.7053335	excellent performance in both our
-0.8998978	we're pleased to increase our
-0.7943018	putters all doing well our
-0.75031185	this business and believe our
-0.52730215	but we also believe our
-0.52730215	accordingly we also believe our
-0.8667806	like me i'm sure our
-0.96752965	also displayed on slide our
-0.75751287	for the quarter but our
-0.75751287	it's within erc but our
-0.75751287	out the bookings but our
-0.8001423	businesses operates differently than our
-1.0662204	well positioned to continue our
-0.8168984	the first quarter so our
-0.779412	it's supply chain across our
-1.1668513	but that has been our
-0.5154507	of this we're anticipating our
-0.5154507	these short term issues our
-0.6958755	and are both getting our
-0.5154507	we expect to achieve our
-0.31249607	plan and are reiterating our
-0.26677957	slide we are reiterating our
-0.26677957	million we are reiterating our
-0.5154507	although we are lowering our
-0.5154507	this opportunity presents evaluating our
-0.5154507	both and when comparing our
-0.422063	is how we evaluate our
-0.422063	as how we evaluate our
-0.5154507	in and when discussing our
-0.5154507	wolfskin acquisition we reevaluated our
-0.5154507	segment reporting and changed our
-0.5154507	with other comparable companies our
-0.7213541	will see it impact our
-0.7213541	throughout the quarter particularly our
-0.31249607	compared to we reiterate our
-0.31249607	the performance we reiterate our
-0.08538153	of we are increasing our
-0.08538153	quarter we are increasing our
-0.08538153	million we are increasing our
-0.8517252	previous guidance we estimate our
-0.5154507	on slide we're refining our
-0.6413793	long term that concludes our
-1.0996932	position and i think our
-1.0996932	wrong but i think our
-0.7791111	brand and we're putting our
-0.7934471	that you've released yes our
-0.7169167	cycle and we're launching our
-0.6413793	year were quite high our
-0.5154507	relevant down to adjust our

-0.8914206	the prices they are in
-0.7064279	that go ahead brian in
-0.76021445	business which generally results in
-0.9441726	back of the presentation in
-0.6897819	very small revenue numbers in
-0.66338253	year as we've discussed in
-0.7706367	you for joining us in
-0.49553093	generally accepted accounting principles in
-1.1330551	business an increase in in
-0.80290806	they can go in in
-0.92077845	quarter where are we in
-1.0388768	that we don't have in
-0.73265785	continue to reinvest back in
-1.0697694	a portion of that in
-0.90190655	really familiar with that in
-0.9737778	description please note that in
-0.8617184	about particularly using that in
-0.49553093	safe harbor statements contained in
-0.7328247	scaling up from there in
-0.7328247	is pretty evident there in
-0.91299	growth involved is it in
-0.7675333	how to apply it in
-0.6765005	ambitions we are also in
-0.6765005	webcasts presentations tab also in
-0.80705655	europe primarily but also in
-1.2736396	balls as well as in
-0.77321124	high our shares now in
-0.69890434	and then also over in
-0.69890434	we saw all over in
-0.7613857	going to be strong in
-0.76273394	it a slow start in
-1.4589534	start to the year in
-0.5234393	year with good performance in
-0.59508216	as continued strong performance in
-0.47357064	year with excellent performance in
-0.47357064	at our competitive performance in
-0.66299194	efforts on that both in
-0.66299194	the lighter orders both in
-0.8817611	between existing soft goods in
-0.7635153	the questions that were in
-0.49448487	the quarter and growth in
-0.49448487	the type of growth in
-0.43311724	strong first quarter growth in
-0.47831106	driven by a growth in
-0.43311724	we anticipate that growth in
-0.5305026	including double digit growth in
-0.43311724	club segments saw growth in
-0.9738308	areas of the business in
-0.8758982	weather but that business in
-1.049393	the jack wolfskin business in
-0.69962513	for our apparel business in
-0.62031716	in our core business in
-0.62031716	overall larger core business in
-0.5791099	equipment business and increase in
-0.7137506	sales increased this increase in
-0.57766104	wolfskin business an increase in
-0.6470239	to million an increase in
-0.57766104	guidance reflects an increase in
-0.8958013	related to jack wolfskin in
-1.0153465	expectations for jack wolfskin in
-0.8958013	you including jack wolfskin in
-0.4698292	of all the brands in
-0.4698292	for our new brands in
-0.74512523	callaway brands revenues increased in
-0.7162076	decrease which is all in
-0.7162076	jack wolfskin business all in
-0.98546684	in all operating segments in
-0.73531157	over year currency negative in
-0.8877344	further foreign exchange headwinds in
-0.90111214	brand internationally and we're in
-0.7226895	up for us we're in
-0.7226895	like the position we're in
-0.49553093	the hard work required in
-0.9718386	you've invested a lot in
-0.7178905	a lot more opportunity in
-0.6897819	the golf industry remains in
-0.6897819	should the conditions improve in
-0.9620293	here turning to slide in
-0.7823791	positive and the market in
-0.6462508	a flat golf market in
-0.6462508	they're down that market in
-0.3950923	to softer market conditions in
-0.3950923	the softer market conditions in
-0.52801883	than expected market conditions in
-0.4785031	to software market conditions in
-0.97114784	adjust our guidance but in
-1.1173155	i think it was in
-0.752164	slide gross margin was in
-0.75046337	believe was approximately flat in
-0.7621786	was million or so in
-0.7621786	the pro forma so in
-0.72248244	continued long term strength in
-0.72626746	one selling model driver in
-0.6853969	at our market shares in
-0.7117572	was or million shares in
-0.9914804	business or the brand in
-0.7797847	contribute to that number in
-0.23959807	we are number one in
-0.23959807	in irons number one in
-0.23959807	all clubs number one in
-0.23959807	in woods number one in
-0.23959807	in drivers number one in
-0.23959807	fairway wood number one in
-0.23959807	in hybrids number one in
-0.7040127	one last quick one in
-0.85804987	term loan entered into in
-0.66338253	tie for that spot in
-0.49553093	and continued upward mobility in
-0.7117994	tied for the lead in
-0.6897819	q and most importantly in
-0.3647375	that we have here in
-0.3647375	i guess both here in
-0.3647375	it was flat here in
-0.3647375	that will launch here in
-0.3647375	for you guys here in
-0.3647375	for the pga here in
-0.7566734	and internationally played out in
-0.7475125	like the trend europe in
-0.66338253	to do it's growing in
-0.7064279	got some upside potential in
-0.77347755	past that ball plant in
-0.7178905	there is expanded distribution in
-0.7751571	i think our projections in
-0.6897819	half of and less in
-0.7064279	obviously still very healthy in
-0.82986796	we like our position in
-0.66338253	continue our leadership positions in
-0.96099114	the game so it's in
-0.6149593	long term it's successful in
-0.29078943	business and continued investments in
-0.29078943	mainly to continued investments in
-0.4698292	of the incremental investments in
-0.49553093	investments and growth initiatives in
-0.8834324	due to the addition in
-0.49553093	also believe our reinvestments in
-0.66511655	that backed up sales in
-0.66511655	driven by increased sales in
-0.8270784	achieved record net sales in
-0.82986796	that but it should in
-0.40155938	the first quarter keep in
-0.40155938	quarter you should keep in
-0.66338253	costs with those factors in
-0.49553093	jack wolfskin acquisition occurred in
-0.40155938	of those now included in
-0.40155938	business was not included in
-1.052722	the jack wolfskin transaction in
-0.9666045	and transition related expenses in
-0.98904026	noncash purchase accounting adjustments in
-0.39171234	on a share basis in
-0.80459964	the higher other expense in
-0.83124363	noncash stock compensation expense in
-0.6386559	ebitda increased to million in
-0.29168957	of compared to million in
-0.12562115	increase compared to million in
-0.1874147	million compared to million in
-0.68548816	wolfskin of the million in
-0.72955436	an increase of million in
-0.6081107	other expense of million in
-0.6762593	operating income of million in
-0.5936048	resulted primarily from million in
-0.68548816	capital expenditures were million in
-0.52596885	operating expense was million in
-0.30379742	other expense was million in
-0.5874838	operating income was million in
-0.6505498	to be approximately million in
-0.61929	will be approximately million in
-0.5936048	it was about million in
-0.12866434	million related to changes in
-0.08817809	negative impact of changes in
-0.12866434	adverse headwinds from changes in
-0.12866434	for net sales changes in
-0.12866434	these estimates assume changes in
-0.6463984	foreign currency exchange rates in
-0.94740325	weakness about gross margin in
-0.747945	and at what point in
-0.51748425	last quarter the decrease in
-0.4682577	and the expected decrease in
-0.4682577	and the concomitant decrease in
-0.74759537	we're launching more products in
-0.7117994	it'll probably be accretive in
-0.1399846	to the same period in
-0.21076035	with the same period in
-0.21076035	for the same period in
-0.40155938	related to the change in
-0.40155938	aiming for no change in
-0.6149593	there some share losses in
-0.7178905	are really growing interest in
-0.6149593	growing interest in availability in
-0.66338253	in days sales outstanding in
-0.8812582	they have a portion in
-0.8250935	estimate our capital expenditures in
-0.49553093	settlement of equity awards in
-0.69625205	of the to range in
-0.6897819	the gross margin estimates in
-0.49553093	set by continued improvements in
-0.49553093	also reflects the shift in
-0.29045704	by net sales increases in
-0.29045704	and hedging gains recorded in
-0.49553093	are anticipated to occur in
-0.6149593	results in operating loss in
-0.5166185	related to the launches in
-0.6377866	equipment new product launches in
-0.49553093	to the same periods in
-0.73265785	of the prior questions in
-0.49553093	the broader competitive backdrop in
-0.9538731	up a little bit in
-0.9538731	down a little bit in
-0.49553093	you're seeing that's resulting in
-0.6149593	ebitda is the weakness in
-0.6006069	bit but we're still in
-0.6006069	golf ball we're still in
-0.69625205	we're still pretty early in
-0.49553093	which is the shipments in
-0.40155938	year those all came in
-0.40155938	rounds played data came in
-0.9374566	you reported i think in
-0.9374566	talked about i think in
-0.8276818	issue the wholesale channel in
-0.66338253	in general is putting in
-1.1370486	golf industry i guess in
-0.6109908	us we were down in
-0.6109908	club margins were down in
-0.7064279	recovery are you expecting in
-0.6149593	continue to see improvement in
-0.38727844	we've got good momentum in
-0.38727844	on all the momentum in
-0.38727844	the brand has momentum in
-0.66338253	business they're less profitable in
-0.7064279	from an ebitda perspective in
-0.5921898	two things you said in
-0.5166185	think you also said in
-0.49553093	all together too disappointed in
-0.6897819	that self could come in
-0.6149593	growth we are investing in
-0.66338253	still some heavier pressure in
-0.66338253	new product launches coming in
-0.6149593	candidly for anybody else in
-0.49553093	we get more experienced in
-0.7751571	think they can go in
-0.66338253	gets a wider indiscernible in
-0.6856542	next year quite frankly in
-0.66338253	the investments we're making in
-0.49553093	a short term penalty in
-0.49553093	how are you feeling in
-0.49553093	we are naturally hedged in
-0.66338253	we're putting our plans in
-0.49553093	so we're still dialing in
-0.6149593	intelligence that takes place in
-0.7432289	about utilization of ai in
-0.49553093	line and our technologies in
-0.6149593	expansion upon the retailers in
-0.49553093	have not really leaned in
-0.49553093	the opportunity to lean in
-0.49553093	coming with some energy in
-0.49553093	came in pretty poor in
-0.49553093	resources is that possible in
-0.49553093	thanks everybody for calling in
-1.137788	accounting principles in the few
-1.0339705	one employee and a few
-0.8215792	you have opened a few
-0.94620466	look forward the next few
-0.7373153	principles in the few instances
-1.0746584	one area will be where
-1.8241508	for the first quarter where
-1.073824	big inflection based on where
-1.2799041	retailers in the us where
-0.52371716	in the few instances where
-0.8536831	brands in key markets where
-1.2626321	and as a result where
-0.41626945	profitability right now versus where
-0.41626945	margins lying now versus where
-1.4472263	and then i guess where
-0.7055304	different buckets the pressure where
-0.3163015	business i'm just wondering where
-0.3163015	coming up just wondering where
-0.8065661	first quarter of and we
-0.8065661	that supports that and we
-0.9253092	higher got it and we
-0.8721272	double digit growth and we
-0.7154163	perform very well and we
-0.8604897	in that brand and we
-0.7154163	major worldwide tours and we
-0.7154163	to the consumer and we
-0.7154163	than initially expected and we
-0.5098965	a good position and we
-0.5098965	a healthy position and we
-0.7154163	anything else yes and we
-0.7154163	mind and understand and we
-0.7154163	off golf courts and we
-0.7154163	it and efforts and we
-0.34525082	non gaap results today we
-0.34525082	our prepared remarks today we
-0.34525082	despite these headwinds today we
-0.34525082	now to slide today we
-0.8008419	the new launches like we
-1.0918427	net sales compared to we
-0.75962013	segment of our company we
-0.9347092	the first quarter of we
-1.0907556	in the first quarter we
-0.7913686	first quarter where are we
-0.7913686	a follow up are we
-0.7707952	steven this is chip we
-1.1709068	our non gaap results we
-1.2181923	shares in the us we
-0.8894949	jack wolfskin business in we
-0.8366543	larger core business in we
-1.3373227	the same period in we
-0.8114016	everybody for calling in we
-0.7784083	the few instances where we
-0.8594533	report non gaap measures we
-0.7962293	we're fine with that we
-0.6809351	to remember also that we
-0.6809351	our team realizes that we
-0.6809351	in increased scale that we
-0.6809351	market and some that we
-0.76441205	with the products that we
-0.6809351	appreciate the support that we
-0.6809351	level of visibility that we
-0.6809351	is an issue that we
-0.76441205	of the synergies that we
-0.53479373	just the fact that we
-0.53479373	clear the fact that we
-0.75485706	from management's current expectations we
-0.68152475	well as good as we
-0.8440493	first quarter and as we
-0.68152475	continue to improve as we
-0.68152475	quite frankly but as we
-0.68152475	in that facility as we
-0.68152475	are increased synergies as we
-1.0096272	start with last year we
-0.75770646	a pretty good performance we
-0.82123923	in operating the performance we
-0.46958748	and soft goods businesses we
-0.8710123	apparel and accessories businesses we
-0.8735485	that process of growth we
-0.7389574	revenue and ebitda growth we
-1.6353599	the jack wolfskin business we
-0.791607	wolfskin north america business we
-0.92629546	and jack wolfskin acquisition we
-0.7982435	the jack wolfskin acquisition we
-0.93841666	business all in all we
-0.7383903	quickly and from all we
-0.7528236	the new reporting segments we
-0.8617747	despite negative fx headwinds we
-0.639608	our portfolio and believe we
-0.7032817	category and i believe we
-0.25313976	position and we believe we
-0.25313976	fx headwinds we believe we
-0.25313976	on slide we believe we
-0.25313976	as usual we believe we
-0.25313976	more importantly we believe we
-0.6945758	the non gaap guidance we
-0.6945758	in our current guidance we
-0.8920046	with our previous guidance we
-0.6681113	growth now on slide we
-0.6681113	as seen on slide we
-1.0953525	up for the market we
-0.9111138	patience on that but we
-0.85224277	of the year but we
-0.7520689	as it relates but we
-0.5109444	expectations overall as usual we
-0.7924663	us more confidence than we
-0.7287077	than the market which we
-0.7287077	lower pre books which we
-0.9411837	the second half which we
-0.71739703	variations and launch timing we
-0.5866864	pre books and so we
-0.5866864	pretty significant and so we
-0.6551075	would have expected so we
-0.6551075	book lead times so we
-0.6551075	of that facility so we
-0.6551075	same weather perspective so we
-0.6551075	a learning curve so we
-0.7545626	this year to date we
-0.77532375	one putter on tour we
-0.5109444	a new strategic initiative we
-0.84005094	perhaps even more importantly we
-0.78860945	outlook and potential here we
-0.87779856	in china and europe we
-0.7708772	the upcoming fallwinter season we
-0.6862627	positions back office infrastructure we
-0.5109444	acquisitions and growth ambitions we
-0.7317629	plans on that currently we
-1.0484186	positions in the industry we
-0.7568424	a very strong position we
-0.7317629	all we are learning we
-0.65894496	the range of what we
-0.65894496	traditional core business what we
-0.65894496	we are generating what we
-0.5109444	we are trending accordingly we
-0.5109444	adjusted ebitda guidance although we
-0.48037934	wholesale distribution when should we
-0.48037934	expected or how should we
-0.48037934	mean how much should we
-1.1040864	the jack wolfskin transaction we
-0.765542	first quarter of when we
-0.68186724	not previously included when we
-0.67090756	and that is how we
-0.67090756	you look at how we
-0.67090756	adjustments that as how we
-0.711705	a product category basis we
-0.711705	on a regional basis we
-0.9508032	that's all and then we
-0.9508032	fair enough and then we
-0.6353677	but due to size we
-0.7317629	over in asia asia we
-0.99531907	operating expenses of million we
-1.0501906	expense for was million we
-1.1041319	shares for approximately million we
-0.885758	higher than the margin we
-0.8951837	us at this point we
-0.8951837	others at this point we
-0.7141371	little foreign currency impact we
-0.5109444	of all things considered we
-0.7141371	opportunities as you saw we
-1.1022916	wondering where you think we
-0.74392384	didn't have average weather we
-0.7024591	been restated but yes we
-0.7024591	at some point yes we
-0.7317629	resources from that perspective we
-0.6353677	of the datatech data we
-0.8031899	just overall i mean we
-0.6353677	the last several months we
-0.6862627	we've found some areas we
-0.6353677	others that are clearly we
-0.6862627	business on what percent we
-0.6862627	then also apparel susan we
-0.7141371	nicely with the consumers we
-0.7141371	there's been no marketing we
-0.6353677	believe within the space we
-0.5109444	my radar screen yet we
-0.5109444	glad to hear somewhere we
-0.69034296	on the term debt we
-0.5109444	term debt we hope we
-0.8365252	few instances where we report
-0.8098166	the channels that they report
-0.9519712	transition related expenses and non
-0.8292971	purchase accounting adjustments and non
-1.3215152	was million compared to non
-1.0650754	travismathew acquisition and the non
-0.8092196	we have reconciled the non
-0.86743855	to note that the non
-0.86743855	we estimate that the non
-1.2305303	as well as the non
-0.8092196	are providing excludes the non
-0.5556108	quarter of excluding the non
-0.45066166	of when excluding the non
-0.45066166	year when excluding the non
-0.93925256	gaap results to our non
-0.78615826	and when comparing our non
-0.78615826	and when discussing our non
-1.1445249	we are increasing our non
-0.8362385	jack wolfskin transaction in non
-0.6522234	instances where we report non
-0.8247256	acquisition we encourage some non
-1.295883	cash purchase accounting adjustments non
-0.70526063	adjusted ebitda guidance excludes non
-0.75367594	better than plan excluding non
-0.7822063	per share was versus non
-1.2870435	increasing our first half non
-0.34131834	million compared to non gaap
-0.44394603	have reconciled the non gaap
-0.4676574	note that the non gaap
-0.13896933	results to our non gaap
-0.13896933	when comparing our non gaap
-0.13896933	when discussing our non gaap
-0.13896933	are increasing our non gaap
-0.34131834	wolfskin transaction in non gaap
-0.34131834	where we report non gaap
-0.34131834	purchase accounting adjustments non gaap
-0.34131834	share was versus non gaap
-0.5252091	measures to the corresponding gaap
-0.6953962	reconciled the non gaap measures
-0.65606034	we report non gaap measures
-0.6102624	to the corresponding gaap measures
-0.8289483	so first question i have
-0.7582598	of what we would have
-0.6758524	to the it would have
-0.9164086	we'd like it to have
-0.85304654	half you're going to have
-0.85304654	think you're going to have
-0.99094194	so it appears to have
-0.80221945	consolidation and helps to have
-0.9271855	making products so you have
-0.42495626	couple of stores you have
-0.42495626	a few stores you have
-1.0500629	first quarter of we have
-0.6955677	non gaap measures we have
-0.36609718	remember also that we have
-0.36609718	team realizes that we have
-0.36609718	increased scale that we have
-0.36609718	and some that we have
-0.36609718	the products that we have
-0.36609718	the synergies that we have
-0.73096204	books and so we have
-0.68842864	lead times so we have
-0.6955677	new strategic initiative we have
-0.6955677	jack wolfskin transaction we have
-0.8356498	all and then we have
-0.6955677	due to size we have
-0.8883605	at this point we have
-0.6955677	been no marketing we have
-0.6955677	within the space we have
-1.106316	europe and china which have
-0.85077244	and the apex irons have
-0.7502105	approximately million we currently have
-0.7318358	tax projections these projections have
-0.6500803	priced products which typically have
-1.0065926	most of the questions have
-0.9424575	and then i just have
-0.9878626	the golf you just have
-0.43379384	visibility that we don't have
-0.43379384	reporting segments we don't have
-0.43379384	apparel susan we don't have
-0.80812776	so i don't really have
-1.0924194	there which i think have
-0.6500803	good performance we didn't have
-0.4641832	gear and other they have
-0.4641832	they have footwear they have
-0.5129233	that i think they have
-0.4641832	new reclassification yes they have
-0.4641832	they have tents they have
-1.0406011	you noted you guys have
-0.8457225	see average selling prices have
-0.6500803	they report into datatech have
-0.5219451	support that we must have
-1.0998329	gaap measures we have reconciled
-1.1256974	gaap measures to the corresponding
-1.0683001	gaap measures at the back
-1.1267325	margin conference in the back
-1.2923343	updated guidance for the back
-1.084964	fx so if you back
-1.107694	i'll turn the call back
-0.6534186	if you would moved back
-0.52442807	also continue to reinvest back
-0.7066113	brand and parallel positions back

-0.758332	the acquisition related costs with
-0.6446511	we are being successful with
-0.51789665	we have been targeting with
-0.51789665	you that for consistency with
-0.7270275	there is obvious seasonality with

-0.48783687	and how that's resonating with
-0.48783687	technology is clearly resonating with
-0.51789665	show or callaway live with
-0.51789665	certainly be the case with
-0.51789665	i'm not really familiar with
-0.51789665	across channels so delighted with
-0.51789665	staff it's the integration with
-0.51789665	own software that integrates with
-0.8308219	presentation in accordance with regulation
-0.5253164	in accordance with regulation g
-0.5252091	accordance with regulation g please
-0.5252091	a more complete description please
-1.1443124	slide i'd like to note
-0.3036833	with regulation g please note
-0.3036833	more complete description please note
-0.7171273	kind of to is that
-0.7171273	with consumers as is that
-0.8086776	issue right now is that
-0.7171273	digits as well is that
-0.7171273	types of resources is that
-0.9224509	the supercomputer itself is that
-1.2688327	the first quarter and that
-1.1529796	traditional equipment business and that
-0.9214893	these nonrecurring expenses and that
-0.8086492	going to be at that
-0.7823455	believe that over time that
-1.023339	winter if you would that
-0.91275775	up and things like that
-0.79745775	did that contribute to that
-0.79745775	improve to get to that

-1.5216331	the first quarter of that
-0.90804785	the last part of that
-0.9500695	basis the majority of that
-0.71047056	plan so some of that
-0.71047056	basis points some of that
-0.71047056	i know some of that
-0.6899266	up a portion of that
-0.65106165	the largest portion of that
-0.8836961	us how much of that
-0.72982824	of the profitability of that
-0.72982824	and the efficiencies of that
-0.72982824	an attractive element of that
-0.72982824	in the specifics of that
-0.7152231	greater wholesale distribution on that
-0.7152231	and we're optimistic on that
-0.7152231	be pretty measured on that
-0.7152231	up some efforts on that
-0.7152231	together on plans on that
-0.7152231	appreciate your patience on that
-0.7510217	an accompanying powerpoint presentation that
-0.7730432	do it's growing in that
-0.7730432	some upside potential in that
-0.7730432	like our position in that
-0.7730432	to see improvement in that
-0.92071146	got good momentum in that
-0.7730432	get more experienced in that
-0.7730432	opportunity to lean in that
-0.7766773	area will be where that
-0.75646424	and scale potential with that
-0.75646424	candidly we're fine with that
-0.75646424	not really familiar with that
-0.29703116	i'd like to note that
-0.19774848	regulation g please note that
-0.19774848	complete description please note that
-0.6339922	include forward looking statements that
-0.5099111	involve risks and uncertainties that
-0.7540339	business was challenged from that
-0.7540339	sharing some resources from that
-1.0378401	it thank you for that
-0.78053534	a statistical tie for that
-0.78053534	you're managing inventory for that
-0.7946026	have to remember also that
-0.81469643	call out here as that
-0.75029236	right now so now that
-0.75029236	think you're saying now that
-0.92943025	europe we are pleased that
-0.79500353	if you back all that
-0.8509244	topgolf and other segments that
-0.6629925	do continue to believe that
-0.6629925	and we do believe that
-0.6339922	analysis and predictive work that
-0.5099111	sure our team realizes that
-0.7124885	small presence and remains that
-0.900344	driven by market conditions that
-0.7508222	for the future but that
-0.7508222	now on weather but that
-0.7508222	in japan specifically but that
-0.9696853	of points higher than that
-0.80412763	year on year was that
-1.1854205	over the long term that
-0.7124885	place now to launch that
-0.97960067	for them and so that
-0.78168476	percentages are lower so that
-1.0172397	with triple track technology that
-0.7421584	there's a competitor set that
-0.7928702	where that brand or that
-0.74464124	of expertise or things that
-0.78722745	of a presence here that
-0.42449677	should we think about that
-0.72089183	to be thinking about that
-0.7490424	how you're thinking about that
-1.1113333	january as a result that
-0.7300462	is there the potential that
-0.7329449	this kind of process that
-0.5099111	significant fx headwind whether that
-0.768999	in that double digits that
-0.7300462	growth in increased scale that
-0.49383608	accessories businesses we anticipate that
-0.49383608	america business we anticipate that
-0.9173887	season we now expect that
-0.80443156	open market and some that
-0.68471646	mind some specific factors that
-0.7421584	exclude these noncash adjustments that
-0.7267669	you're going to see that
-0.7267669	full year you see that
-0.64844316	successful with the products that
-0.64844316	within the new products that
-0.6339922	would assume that plus that
-0.7421584	term loan b facility that
-0.68471646	we appreciate the support that
-0.82073826	so i would assume that
-0.83979785	currency impact we estimate that
-0.68471646	designing your own software that
-0.8994303	to answer the questions that
-0.68471646	a level of visibility that
-1.0069382	technology and i think that
-0.9069122	or pricing i think that
-0.63274324	consumer and we think that
-0.63274324	with that we think that
-0.63274324	the consumers we think that
-0.68471646	margin is an issue that
-0.5299899	to those numbers did that
-0.5299899	reported how much did that
-0.900344	good chunk that's helpful that
-0.7854115	good but they're down that
-0.6205742	discussed in the past that
-0.65193003	said in the past that
-0.68471646	we're in a cycle that
-0.6339922	now in the channels that
-0.7124885	there are some others that
-0.5099111	a cycle that supports that
-0.6649907	some of the synergies that
-0.56567013	there are some synergies that
-0.36336398	if just the fact that
-0.36336398	very clear the fact that
-0.5099111	making more maybe anticipation that
-0.5099111	open devices et cetera that
-0.768999	was warm which means that
-0.5099111	outside of the trends that
-0.7124885	terms of demand consumers that
-0.5099111	and we really find that
-0.5099111	we want to control that
-0.5099111	thinking about time lining that
-0.29703116	if you're not using that
-0.29703116	think about particularly using that
-0.5099111	the added ball speed that
-0.5099111	going to be something that
-0.5099111	change like artificial intelligence that
-0.5099111	an example of item that
-0.5099111	yes we will send that
-0.7770443	now to slide i will
-0.9712878	and answered but i will
-0.7770443	factors in mind i will
-0.8057846	note that this call will
-0.9920074	and understand and we will
-0.9317617	prepared remarks today we will
-0.95491964	increased synergies as we will
-0.97823757	learning curve so we will
-0.41069946	product category basis we will
-0.41069946	a regional basis we will
-0.86888695	restated but yes we will
-0.81109846	that over time that will
-1.004731	business we anticipate that will
-1.140651	and we think that will
-0.8295854	next few years it will
-0.41369256	believe our other businesses will
-0.41369256	in those other businesses will
-0.9725454	ebitda from this business will
-1.0442027	past that the business will
-1.0238572	underway many of which will
-1.1709987	results our adjusted ebitda will
-1.3058296	full year net sales will
-1.167161	cash stock compensation expense will
-0.9525375	that the ball margins will
-0.8066213	certain markets and they will
-0.7335596	see that technology others will
-0.5230075	independently but one area will
-0.82151306	that this call will include
-0.80763185	extend through mid these include
-0.65437716	this call will include forward
-0.7070749	industry as you look forward
-0.63309383	time attention we'll look forward
-0.48236784	optimistic on that going forward
-0.48236784	other product categories going forward
-0.48236784	jack wolfskin's distribution going forward
-0.48236784	versus share repurchase going forward
-0.48236784	in broad way going forward
-0.785114	call will include forward looking
-1.0058491	that we're not really looking
-0.73539764	it looks like you're looking
-0.8313491	that plus that you're looking
-0.73722196	will include forward looking statements
-0.5252091	review the safe harbor statements
-0.8364818	forward looking statements that involve
-0.5253164	looking statements that involve risks
-0.83794856	that involve risks and uncertainties
-0.81495476	in these markets you could
-0.81495476	i guess maybe you could
-0.82458603	risks and uncertainties that could
-0.82458603	example of item that could
-0.8299057	that was seasonality but could
-0.52496195	maybe anticipation that self could
-0.8734163	and uncertainties that could cause
-0.5253164	uncertainties that could cause actual
-0.9625018	cause actual results to differ
-0.5253164	actual results to differ materially
-0.83131635	this business quickly and from
-0.8248808	plus that you're looking from
-0.52018034	results to differ materially from
-0.80923474	kind of scaling up from
-0.77613103	given the adverse headwinds from
-1.1018846	the second half which from
-0.7988408	you guys called out from
-0.8025022	we're anticipating our ebitda from
-0.81140715	timing of some sales from
-0.97260296	in of operating expenses from
-0.52018034	as well as royalties from
-0.82514834	in which includes million from
-0.7289779	expense in resulted primarily from
-0.36874434	your first question comes from
-0.031655993	your next question comes from
-0.52018034	line of steven zaccone from
-0.52018034	line of dave king from
-0.70016605	was actually slightly profitable from
-0.52018034	context to not alarming from
-0.30130085	line of brett andress from
-0.52018034	line of michael swartz from
-0.52018034	line of daniel imbro from
-0.7289779	the synergies really come from
-0.52018034	we are literally drinking from

-0.52018034	line of susan anderson from
-0.52018034	wolfskin business was challenged from
-0.52018034	line of randy konik from
-0.52018034	think about your learnings from

-0.52018034	line of alex maroccia from
-0.52018034	line of casey alexander from
-0.8250227	to differ materially from management's
-1.3118862	as well as the current
-1.0774107	reflected this in our current
-0.9906545	million remaining under our current
-0.52514005	differ materially from management's current
-0.7483696	first quarter versus your expectations
-0.7483696	you're taking down your expectations
-0.7483696	think you said your expectations
-1.0102398	pretty close to our expectations
-0.736448	materially from management's current expectations
-0.4204507	jack wolfskin business met expectations
-0.4204507	by region but met expectations
-0.52478385	candidly met or exceeded expectations

-0.7579698	how you're managing inventory for
-0.8652821	this time capital expenditures for
-0.748965	really have a estimate for
-0.5138855	the first half conversely for
-0.5138855	in the guidance cut for
-0.63928896	is an achievable level for
-0.71884227	the estimates by channel for
-0.690674	in the overall cycle for
-0.5138855	was an expected outcome for
-0.5336799	incremental investment and building for
-0.5336799	young players excitement building for
-0.7762432	to lower the forecast for
-0.8733996	for us and candidly for
-0.5138855	you're kind of aiming for
-0.63928896	process that you use for
-0.83382094	that marketing messaging and more
-1.0923154	gross margins due to more
-0.83098936	press release for a more
-0.93516445	it also gives us more
-1.0004001	china or is it more
-1.2180766	we have a lot more
-1.0068132	helpful and then one more
-0.75050974	several years perhaps even more
-0.73212266	we've become not only more
-0.6503179	price products and having more
-0.889798	you just provide some more
-0.781618	you just shed some more
-1.4002726	in the first half more
-1.0450048	so it's a little more
-0.6503179	in which are weighted more
-1.0231397	getting a little bit more
-0.45432085	elaborate a little bit more
-0.7725234	secondly and a probably more
-1.4345146	and then i guess more
-0.7275744	remember because we're launching more
-0.7632151	improve as we get more
-0.70310825	or are you making more
-0.819113	release for a more complete
-0.5253164	for a more complete description
-1.0431556	please note that in connection
-0.9990319	i think in your prepared
-1.0458363	in connection with our prepared

-0.8307662	and things like that there
-0.8184012	of scaling up from there
-0.92743075	with our prepared remarks there
-0.8082003	of the economies over there
-0.8046715	though has been strong there
-0.8247096	this year's forecast but there
-0.8006898	of young players out there
-0.70176846	was two months ago there
-1.1815395	of the gross margin there
-0.76167667	some very good points there
-0.80571264	at this point if there
-1.0587364	some areas we think there
-0.64913124	the puts and takes there
-0.5212384	okay that's good color there
-0.5212384	strength is pretty evident there
-0.76238346	about cost base synergies there
-0.70176846	with some macro pressure there
-0.8873193	an inflection i know there
-0.72615707	good for the game there
-0.64913124	operated separately even though there
-0.5212384	type of early poster there
-0.93736845	really find that is an
-0.9151046	prepared remarks there is an
-0.9531013	the algorithms it is an
-0.75381106	the new guidance is an
-0.75381106	timing the margin is an
-1.1283861	share guidance to to an
-1.0040983	basically can't give you an
-2.0211735	the first quarter of an
-0.98706126	using that type of an
-0.68108433	is a bit of an
-0.68108433	really a bit of an
-0.82911205	cycle for golf in an
-1.6876624	compared to million in an
-0.821269	actually slightly profitable from an
-0.8301105	are a flat as an
-0.8643974	accessories businesses offset by an
-0.7322262	being adversely affected by an
-2.0066986	the jack wolfskin business an
-1.0538219	lower so that was an
-1.3017726	of million to million an
-0.8827038	accounts receivable for million an
-0.92498153	operating expenses were million an
-0.7044522	inventory needed to support an
-0.6515079	of billion to billion an
-0.70518297	the new guidance reflects an
-0.5230075	cetera that is absolutely an
-1.0315646	remarks there is an accompanying
-0.5253164	there is an accompanying powerpoint
-0.7077999	powerpoint presentation that may make
-0.7852852	so you can obviously make
-0.9035569	and china or is it
-0.7923055	in market share is it
-0.7923055	strong growth involved is it
-0.9551585	outside of golf and it
-0.979635	front of us and it
-1.2727673	of the year and it
-0.9655047	bit in europe and it
-0.79727775	to be wider and it
-0.8499085	cooperative as we'd like it
-0.75021434	the product seems like it
-1.1070359	moved back to the it
-0.7076579	overall the i call it
-0.63358545	off to we'll call it
-0.63358545	outlook for million call it
-0.72500813	pour through our numbers it
-1.4054813	the same period in it
-1.106751	susan we don't have it
-0.8678032	are revenues associated with it
-0.9440394	we're very pleased with it
-0.76437813	it's the integration with it
-0.99688154	equipment business and that it
-0.95535433	wolfskin's distribution going forward it
-0.64441663	presentation that may make it
-0.82387906	our for you as it
-1.681701	half of the year it
-0.8219176	accretive to overall business it
-1.273355	us for jack wolfskin it
-0.72500813	as well as several it
-0.7555771	the next few years it
-0.5115621	specifics of that but it
-0.5115621	and remains that but it
-0.3949436	jack wolfskin business but it
-0.3949436	the travismathew business but it
-0.7186608	through or not but it
-0.7186608	to this earlier but it
-0.8040317	million is worse than it
-0.78707504	number in q was it
-0.78707504	of brett's questions was it
-0.90365	driver in golf so it
-0.79237753	our perspective understood so it
-0.902086	or so in revenue it
-1.2185858	to be thinking about it
-0.80255735	nearly two times what it
-0.6136863	office infrastructure we expect it
-0.6136863	that currently we expect it
-0.64441663	others will be following it
-0.80147195	on a global basis it
-0.7970874	on the facility then it
-0.8791925	little bit in asia it
-0.6585987	and we will see it
-0.6585987	quarter well we'll see it
-0.7555771	assume it's premature estimate it
-0.5177215	including the strategic benefits it
-0.69645	provides and the opportunities it
-0.64441663	and the so far it
-0.9213187	of revenue i think it
-0.9213187	term goals i think it
-1.1095353	versus where you think it
-0.74457085	half which we did it
-0.216768	if you would got it
-0.216768	think in q got it
-0.216768	gear and other got it
-0.216768	and gross margin got it
-0.216768	business is higher got it
-0.216768	on board okay got it
-0.216768	in the wholesale got it
-0.216768	of the forecast got it
-0.74309015	from a mixed perspective it
-0.64441663	was set and done it
-0.5177215	bookings are strong indicator it
-0.81657356	the geographies i mean it
-0.64441663	learn how to apply it
-0.5177215	think that the reason it
-0.5177215	into creating the algorithms it
-0.83314115	that may make it easier
-0.96228135	easier for you to follow
-1.0457039	i just have a follow
-0.56130266	the quarter just a follow
-0.56130266	is open just a follow

-0.9573855	expected to cover the negative
-0.83468044	rates in while a negative
-0.7361583	the year and despite negative

-0.9196204	offset by an estimated negative
-1.3773905	basis points related to fx
-0.73673785	basis and that's despite fx
-0.768546	year and despite negative fx
-0.8330213	us overcoming a significant fx
-0.49320328	and that's despite fx headwinds
-0.49320328	and despite negative fx headwinds
-0.80652356	first quarter despite these headwinds
-0.5054862	due to foreign exchange headwinds
-0.5054862	despite further foreign exchange headwinds
-0.7675517	basis higher than further headwinds
-0.77709275	and we shouldn't expect headwinds
-0.52460593	result given the adverse headwinds
-1.0901638	of this business and believe
-0.8306552	in our portfolio and believe
-0.7447798	putter category and i believe
-0.7447798	move advantage and i believe
-0.91828376	it i'm sure i believe
-1.3590002	we do continue to believe
-1.056868	healthy position and we believe
-0.7519358	negative fx headwinds we believe
-0.89133966	our current guidance we believe
-0.91555524	now on slide we believe
-0.7519358	overall as usual we believe
-0.89133966	the market which we believe
-0.7519358	even more importantly we believe
-0.791139	year but we also believe
-0.791139	trending accordingly we also believe
-1.1662318	efforts and we do believe
-0.44114673	believe we are on track
-0.17421553	market reaction to triple track
-0.17421553	the erc with triple track
-0.17421553	track technology that triple track
-0.17421553	term i know triple track
-1.129313	are on track for another
-0.9217397	the callaway golf and we're
-0.8797617	areas right now and we're
-0.9585125	year of growth and we're
-1.1223611	in that business and we're
-0.94435537	jack wolfskin brand and we're
-0.77377486	still quite healthy and we're
-0.77377486	this particular cycle and we're
-0.77377486	the brand internationally and we're
-1.0491277	a result of this we're
-1.0207939	going up for us we're
-0.99562126	wholesale distribution on that we're
-0.9462857	scale potential with that we're
-0.7910901	of the trends that we're
-0.7910901	to be something that we're
-0.8255152	we don't have it we're
-1.0450417	distribution centers and as we're
-1.0192014	of mid next year we're
-0.8003557	so i think overall we're
-1.0132432	we're learning a lot we're
-0.98007786	in also on slide we're
-0.90332085	had last year but we're
-0.7921228	a little bit but we're
-0.7772601	erc golf ball which we're
-0.7772601	the learning curves which we're
-0.7960011	of next year so we're
-0.7960011	pre books yes so we're
-1.1095593	term the golf ball we're
-0.842381	chip as chip mentioned we're
-0.7848493	cash flow and capital we're
-0.7708524	we'd like the position we're
-0.80719566	that's not really what we're
-0.7304492	terms of the investments we're
-0.947988	positive free cash flow we're
-0.9197308	transformation process and if we're
-0.9022948	performance in the marketplace we're
-0.52035654	along those same lines we're
-0.8156817	i mean we think we're
-0.8156817	are clearly we think we're
-0.80246514	thinking about that yes we're
-0.70043266	it's still very profitable we're
-0.6197795	are flat and candidly we're
-0.5396827	time keeping up candidly we're
-0.6479478	from there in fact we're

-0.7499056	transaction as seen on slide
-0.83061713	guidance which begins with slide
-0.8320825	in the industry you had
-0.75351346	double digits that brian had
-0.58146095	the first quarter we had
-0.79700184	this is chip we had
-0.79700184	with last year we had
-0.79700184	than the margin we had
-1.0566097	i believe we also had
-1.0039545	in the golf business had
-1.118286	presentation our equipment business had
-0.76658285	the brand side we've had
-1.0135034	marketing we have not had
-0.80790824	period and if they had
-0.65270114	in that they've always had
-0.7058004	track and our indiscernible had
-1.0761698	is positive and the market
-0.93355376	for the quarter the market
-1.2331895	that business in the market
-1.1156799	your expectations for the market
-1.0189369	flat up for the market
-0.93355376	grew faster than the market
-0.82741225	in a flat golf market
-1.3922204	you look at our market
-0.8190211	you've released yes our market
-0.81907403	excellent and our us market
-0.9612023	involved is it in market
-0.8339889	but they're down that market
-1.0289202	revenues up driven by market
-0.49235147	over due to softer market
-0.49235147	effects of the softer market
-0.54789853	as softer than expected market
-0.54789853	and slower than expected market
-1.0160009	there in a healthy market
-0.41938993	finally including both open market
-0.41938993	software packages both open market
-0.70526063	is due to software market
-0.8383913	potential that should the conditions
-0.59310174	up driven by market conditions
-0.3467102	due to softer market conditions
-0.3467102	of the softer market conditions
-0.47666004	softer than expected market conditions
-0.47666004	slower than expected market conditions
-0.59310174	due to software market conditions
-0.8364818	by market conditions that varied
-0.5253164	market conditions that varied widely
-0.81452286	that varied widely by region
-0.8179827	more weighted toward one region
-0.8114527	the trend is good but
-0.79675424	the guidance last time but
-1.1366048	expectations for the quarter but
-1.0807884	for jack wolfskin in but
-1.0517008	the specifics of that but
-1.0162278	your patience on that but
-0.80384195	presence and remains that but
-0.99002135	very pleased with it but
-1.5294353	half of the year but
-0.9854537	we had last year but
-1.7054316	the jack wolfskin business but
-1.126851	of the travismathew business but
-1.2725271	channel for jack wolfskin but
-0.6401928	is in our guidance but
-0.6401928	to adjust our guidance but
-0.6441822	varied widely by region but
-0.81996363	year's average euro so but
-0.69618577	i guess separately run but
-0.76619846	been year to date but
-0.7247259	and it's within erc but
-0.69618577	we must have received but
-0.8959486	building for the future but
-0.89156103	us japan and europe but
-0.69618577	not only more confident but
-0.80581224	going through or not but
-0.79675424	little bit since then but
-0.7247259	over in europe primarily but
-0.72654086	of that was seasonality but
-0.72654086	part of our range but
-1.1452408	declined a little bit but
-0.86928785	break out the bookings but
-0.7552744	europe now on weather but
-0.8365033	higher average selling prices but
-0.7552744	dave so and no but
-0.5175464	you as it relates but
-0.5175464	and our own retail but
-0.69618577	in this year's forecast but
-0.5175464	me if i'm wrong but
-0.7247259	help us and others but
-0.6441822	alluded to this earlier but
-0.72025406	of that is helping but
-0.72025406	right now quite frankly but
-0.5175464	best of my knowledge but
-0.5175464	an industry wide phenomenon but
-0.69618577	year in japan specifically but
-0.5175464	brand is golf dna but
-0.72025406	on the golf courts but
-0.5175464	run kind of independently but
-0.5175464	been asked and answered but
-0.5175464	out of your garage but
-0.5175464	q has been restated but
-2.0576234	the jack wolfskin business met
-0.83015466	widely by region but met
-0.7557099	the board has candidly met
-0.83283675	met expectations overall as usual
-1.3203135	usual we believe we grew
-0.5253164	we believe we grew faster
-0.52318484	believe we grew faster than
-0.7343931	as well as softer than
-0.70682466	business will be lower than
-0.625676	will be to lower than
-0.6622386	have led to lower than
-0.7338476	whether that was less than
-0.6517462	the year and slower than
-0.49206802	could come in better than
-0.49206802	which was slightly better than
-0.795769	typically much better margins than
-0.4727279	see it being higher than
-0.4727279	which is basis higher than
-0.4727279	couple of points higher than
-0.4727279	on the little higher than
-1.4074031	in the first half than
-0.70472157	assuming travismathew was greater than
-0.70472157	terms of products broader than
-0.70472157	gives us more confidence than
-0.52318484	apparel businesses operates differently than
-0.52318484	almost million is worse than
-1.1053213	the first quarter of which
-0.81672156	projects underway many of which
-0.81672156	year gross margins of which
-0.9532715	you just comment on which
-0.99871624	the incremental investments in which
-1.3352271	be approximately million in which
-0.81665325	the economies over there which
-1.6715895	start to the year which
-1.018463	segment being golf equipment which
-1.7452205	the jack wolfskin business which
-1.1373014	by the travismathew business which
-0.80202484	have offset their travismathew which
-0.933823	comment on our guidance which
-1.0723058	compared to previous guidance which
-1.0257776	faster than the market which
-1.0153984	new erc golf ball which
-1.0653841	decrease of million or which
-0.6941442	central europe and china which
-0.94848394	to lower pre books which
-0.789137	for the fallwinter season which
-0.64865744	ball plant capital project which
-1.1845605	apparel gear and other which
-1.074565	pressure where and then which
-1.1356664	to million to million which
-1.046448	approximately million to million which
-0.87704396	of million the decrease which
-0.7884848	of higher priced products which
-0.52088535	flow items available liquidity which
-0.64865744	lower effective tax rate which
-1.0338131	in the second half which
-0.7012336	the weather was warm which
-0.52088535	followed by last summer which
-0.52088535	up the learning curves which
-0.82743764	then i guess i was
-0.831226	like you expected the was
-1.037313	that number in q was
-0.8213645	first question i have was
-0.77499354	if you would that was
-0.94595337	know some of that was
-0.85779274	how much of that was
-0.8813179	are lower so that was
-0.77499354	fx headwind whether that was
-0.77499354	loan b facility that was
-0.8090662	business da expense for was
-0.8090662	gaap operating income for was
-0.63704556	things like that there was
-0.63704556	two months ago there was
-0.63704556	the gross margin there was
-0.63704556	puts and takes there was
-0.7749663	in europe and it was
-0.72177833	product seems like it was
-0.64546114	is worse than it was
-0.64546114	so in revenue it was
-0.64546114	two times what it was
-0.64546114	a global basis it was
-0.64546114	bit in asia it was
-0.5604459	revenue i think it was
-0.5604459	goals i think it was
-0.8225587	bit year on year was
-1.0304564	a result that business was
-1.7365355	the jack wolfskin business was
-0.6318362	quarter of this increase was
-0.6318362	the quarter this increase was
-0.8093128	got it dave jack was
-0.80077887	and i'm assuming travismathew was
-0.81214786	last year when all was
-1.0375081	market which we believe was
-1.2416528	first quarter of which was
-0.7770514	by last summer which was
-0.7289779	particularly our biggest launch was
-1.1001699	the epic flash driver was
-0.80895424	of different factors one was
-0.7988408	trying to parse out was
-0.66767395	margin basis operating expense was
-0.5046256	wolfskin acquisitions other expense was
-0.5046256	currency rates other expense was
-0.74680686	depreciation and amortization expense was
-0.99583524	yes dave the million was
-1.0211538	on slide gross margin was
-0.98428667	foreign currency gross margins was
-0.77058876	quarter of this decrease was
-0.86144745	equipment business operating income was
-0.6153798	diluted earnings per share was
-0.52018034	plus cash on hand was
-0.77613103	one of brett's questions was
-0.8620502	which means the weather was
-0.6477115	midpoint are the booking was
-0.9197369	expenditures in to be approximately
-1.073168	is estimated to be approximately
-1.006885	compensation expense will be approximately
-0.7366274	of this facility associated approximately
-0.4106195	repurchased million shares for approximately
-0.80481577	europe and china were approximately
-0.82957983	which we believe was approximately
-1.1053278	you had kind of flat
-1.0839127	the market we are flat
-0.81332624	for the market are flat
-0.93973535	that we are a flat
-1.0805155	exchange headwinds in a flat
-1.0048668	the i call it flat
-1.0774682	europe and it was flat
-0.75437915	we believe was approximately flat
-0.52407247	ball margins were relatively flat
-0.75410104	expected so we said flat
-0.52407247	start in q roughly flat
-1.1184039	and that with the exception
-0.963604	businesses will cover the short
-0.8370905	with the exception of short
-0.83521026	we are paying a short
-0.8071776	guidance we believe these short
-1.1195002	pay down on the term
-1.009338	principal outstanding under our term
-0.17405143	will cover the short term
-0.17405143	the exception of short term
-0.17405143	are paying a short term
-0.17405143	we believe these short term
-0.11224517	some of the long term
-0.11224517	change in the long term
-0.11224517	business for the long term
-0.12313162	creation over the long term
-0.11224517	energized by the long term
-0.042522904	excited about the long term
-0.30542043	our reinvestments in long term
-0.30542043	stage for continued long term
-0.30542043	it can go long term
-1.3262076	related to the new term
-0.6534186	some medium to longer term
-0.6534186	the medium to near term
-0.95824385	segment reclassification results for quarterly
-1.0060916	exception of short term quarterly
-0.6546147	of short term quarterly variations
-0.83749	term quarterly variations and launch
-0.9617743	in place now to launch
-0.98997724	we anticipate that will launch
-0.52496195	quarter particularly our biggest launch
-1.1324769	the shift in the timing
-1.298874	as well as the timing
-0.8309788	reflects the intra year timing
-0.73673785	quarterly variations and launch timing
-0.52496195	expenses is just strictly timing
-1.120836	launch timing we are positioned
-0.8130385	believe we are well positioned
-0.9859873	if we're able to continue
-0.42737067	we are positioned to continue
-0.42737067	are well positioned to continue
-1.4968736	that we're going to continue
-1.1085241	worldwide tours and we continue
-1.0376647	regional basis we will continue
-0.76118356	the ball margins will continue
-1.0575769	potential here we also continue
-0.8079928	the success of travismathew continue
-0.80917823	yes and we do continue
-0.7431269	and so we do continue
-0.89969546	our us market shares continue
-0.9462613	better margins than just continue
-0.95079017	to better understand this do
-0.9543271	estimate for you i do
-1.1896256	positioned to continue to do
-0.6969397	business also continues to do
-0.6969397	brett travis continues to do

-1.0449119	us got off to we'll
-0.812214	saw this quarter well we'll
-0.82249236	you i do think we'll
-0.52478385	for your time attention we'll
-0.8383913	and we'll set the foundation
-0.82966673	there the national golf foundation
-1.0368966	year results and are thus
-0.73714036	backdrop in the clubs thus
-0.6546147	results and are thus confirming
-0.83794856	and ebitda guidance and raising
-1.0762805	eps guidance based on slightly
-0.9531652	quarter of which was slightly
-0.7076949	dave jack was actually slightly
-0.8078294	based on slightly lower financing
-0.81028146	business excluding one time costs
-0.7945109	out from higher product costs
-0.80538636	to the acquisition related costs
-0.52460593	on slightly lower financing costs
-0.7985503	prices but also higher costs
-0.7675517	driven by lower interest costs
-1.0145924	lower financing costs and tax
-0.52514005	and a lower effective tax
-0.75562847	businesses and lower estimated tax
-1.402122	you look at our projections
-1.0213165	but i think our projections
-0.807505	and tax projections these projections
-0.7076949	financing costs and tax projections
-0.82222587	these projections have us overcoming
-0.8215792	there is also a significant
-0.8215792	have us overcoming a significant
-0.79920816	transformation process it's pretty significant
-0.737028	going to keep any significant
-0.73722196	overcoming a significant fx headwind
-0.9550127	to be a million headwind
-0.6546147	a significant fx headwind whether
-0.96287197	second half of and less
-0.8376135	general is putting in less
-1.0595443	headwind whether that was less
-0.7368763	jack wolfskin business they're less
-0.81714773	that was less than desired
-1.2530706	start the year and slower
-1.2849295	little bit of a slower
-1.0259309	of the business is apparel
-0.8166316	the second segment is apparel
-1.0590218	question first so the apparel
-1.0282309	it's not just the apparel
-0.8285914	housekeeping i guess the apparel
-0.9880734	market conditions for our apparel
-0.8198938	supply chain across our apparel
-0.8367536	have a portion in apparel
-1.1130899	accessories and then also apparel
-0.6747348	company's other golf equipment apparel
-0.16936022	the core golf equipment apparel
-0.67924935	in the core equipment apparel
-1.2617954	ogio and jack wolfskin apparel
-0.91543585	golf clothes golf balls apparel
-0.7831734	the gear accessories versus apparel
-1.1105918	the future of the industry
-1.0867081	are at in the industry
-1.0867081	leadership positions in the industry
-1.320741	we think that the industry

-0.6924708	industry is in a healthy
-0.62193	evident there in a healthy
-0.62193	industry remains in a healthy
-0.62193	so it's in a healthy
-0.98900664	it's obviously still very healthy
-0.73712546	industry is still quite healthy
-0.991387	is in a good position
-1.0730289	so we'd like the position
-0.8210602	and we like our position
-1.0764041	too disappointed in our position
-0.9275812	in a very strong position
-0.8123637	is in a healthy position

-0.8357211	positioned to continue our leadership
-0.52514005	to continue our leadership positions
-0.77790993	because of their inventory positions
-0.52514005	travismathew brand and parallel positions

-0.95088995	keeping up candidly we're learning
-1.1211809	are learning we are increasingly
-0.829418	direct to consumer is it's
-0.8207169	within chrome soft and it's
-1.3733325	of that business and it's
-0.8207169	is really resonating and it's
-1.0119001	mean it sounds like it's
-0.7892306	and beyond thanks chip it's
-1.1276388	and soft goods business it's
-1.2506434	purchase of jack wolfskin it's
-1.031792	advantage and i believe it's
-0.76495075	must have received but it's
-0.76495075	us and others but it's
-0.76495075	is golf dna but it's
-1.2399952	for the long term it's
-1.0971738	travis continues to do it's
-0.8661822	the year and so it's
-0.7857025	of traditional golf so it's
-0.6984265	market share overall so it's
-0.7857025	of other products so it's
-0.6984265	in the game so it's
-0.9152234	back all that out it's
-0.85010415	through a transformation process it's
-0.8093772	going to be what it's
-0.79570866	think to brian's point it's
-0.8449777	point i would assume it's
-1.0914551	consumer interest i think it's
-0.7496127	thanks chip it's dave it's
-0.99865407	the rounds were down it's
-0.52159154	a few independent agents it's
-0.73126274	a little harder casey it's
-0.52159154	what we're facing anymore it's
-0.52159154	engineering and support staff it's
-0.7780334	and we are being successful
-0.8248209	the long term it's successful
-0.8379562	term it's successful in achieving
-0.830202	the estimated earnings and adjusted
-0.830202	our net sales and adjusted
-0.8281343	keep in mind this adjusted
-0.83702236	we now expect the adjusted
-2.2170947	the first quarter of adjusted
-0.8201851	these financial results our adjusted
-0.8201851	other comparable companies our adjusted
-1.0618134	quarter and growth in adjusted
-1.1792483	million an increase in adjusted
-0.99398273	the expected decrease in adjusted
-0.8576269	are reiterating our previous adjusted
-1.2908248	increasing our first half adjusted
-0.5442625	growing in that double digits
-0.5442625	will be up double digits
-0.5252091	of the high single digits
-1.0733116	first last year and nearly
-1.0791085	worse than it was two
-0.52460593	last year and nearly two
-0.7361583	what it was only two
-1.0844353	look like and then two
-1.3597194	jack wolfskin i think two
-0.8104774	you have sales down two
-0.75581396	longer pre book lead times
-0.7686075	year and nearly two times
-1.6087261	it's going to be what
-0.94461966	going forward and at what
-0.8336653	we don't anticipate to what
-0.9591742	within the range of what
-0.9352305	to consumer based on what
-0.97338665	little bit more on what
-0.7481663	for the business on what
-0.7481663	some more detail on what
-0.7481663	some more light on what
-0.96999025	product categories going forward what
-1.049619	our traditional core business what
-1.0040141	the little higher than what
-0.82798386	the year here so what
-0.8171667	that mainly involves or what
-0.86620617	i guess more importantly what
-0.6515079	and nearly two times what
-0.9994303	but that's not really what
-0.79170746	achievable are they still what
-0.6515079	hope we are generating what
-1.0802054	times what it was only
-0.8185353	information we've become not only
-0.82439977	all that out it's only
-0.8139776	now and we're really only
-1.0072366	what happened a year ago
-0.7684867	was only two years ago
-0.65437716	it was two months ago
-1.0898337	ago this is the type
-0.96119654	you're not using that type
-0.737028	are you seeing any type
-0.8221408	helps to have good scale
-0.8372598	the broader reach and scale
-0.9896293	over time that will scale
-0.798539	of growth in increased scale
-0.65389764	that will scale it'll scale
-1.0117664	that we have been targeting
-1.7042241	in terms of the investments
-1.0684606	been targeting with our investments
-0.7066079	wolfskin business and continued investments
-0.6326999	due mainly to continued investments
-0.70742375	timing of the incremental investments
-0.98719156	our investments and growth initiatives
-0.48038107	primarily due to the addition
-1.1202157	is attributable to the addition

-0.9326705	north america business we anticipate
-0.92465425	that perspective we don't anticipate
-0.9610443	that could lead to further
-0.7361583	delivered these results despite further
-1.008322	is basis higher than further
-0.85781944	ebitda growth we anticipate further

-1.0380008	we did it and those
-0.93627346	equipment margins look like those
-0.9574128	improved confidence relative to those
-0.9801561	factored into most of those
-0.78456163	negative in both of those
-0.78456163	and then which of those
-0.78456163	two are any of those
-0.9639671	point the nature of those
-0.78456163	get this none of those
-0.8298473	wanted to confirm are those
-1.0792423	anticipate that growth in those
-0.9852495	i'm just wondering where those
-0.8279381	acquisition related costs with those
-1.338684	q of the year those
-0.7882869	business it's logistics across those
-0.79167527	as well as europe those
-1.0177641	more detail on what those
-0.52283025	one region and along those
-0.52283025	it would have translated those
-0.76444966	you could eventually get those
-0.52283025	can't afford to access those
-1.0854867	mind i will now provide
-1.2231858	one can you just provide
-1.0859418	wolfskin business to be million

-1.111977	jack wolfskin of the million
-0.8243818	book yes dave the million
-0.8243818	but then sorry the million
-0.3007532	of an increase of million

-1.02444	of which is a million
-0.98192537	going to be a million
-0.7487174	think you guys reported million
-1.0307585	quarter of we have million
-0.7902343	million we currently have million
-0.8181154	in resulted primarily from million
-0.9265388	in your outlook for million

-0.31508335	quarter of we repurchased million
-0.31508335	of when we repurchased million
-0.9108723	affected by an estimated million
-0.7706381	ago there was probably million
-0.74957454	revenue jack wolfskin did million
-0.52106184	contributed or they booked million
-0.52106184	those sales into ish million
-0.88808805	think prior you said million
-0.52106184	is currency really almost million
-1.231602	of million related to changes
-1.0252938	the negative impact of changes
-0.9545629	point negative impact of changes

-1.060831	increased this increase in constant
-0.9625647	constant currency basis and excluding
-2.226436	the first quarter of excluding
-1.3887423	new jack wolfskin business excluding
-0.7071528	slightly better than plan excluding
-0.78848594	a decrease of when excluding
-0.78848594	the prior year when excluding
-0.82651657	business can leverage your core
-1.1054902	adjusted ebitda on the core
-1.0647006	an increase in the core
-1.0647006	sales outstanding in the core
-0.4620551	sales increases in the core
-0.82933855	market and candidly the core
-1.099841	we would in our core
-0.9290836	increase in constant currency core
-0.52460593	support an overall larger core
-0.79606265	have in our traditional core
-1.0824646	all right are you including
-1.3897367	our jack wolfskin business including
-0.6541373	in all major regions including
-0.52496195	first quarter of finally including
-1.328849	we do continue to see
-1.254279	that you're going to see
-0.8138979	the full year you see
-1.1630195	maybe how do you see
-1.0124792	distribution when should we see
-1.0517116	understand and we will see
-0.9653396	business as you can see
-1.0273246	this point we do see
-0.7541167	this quarter well we'll see
-0.6531793	issue that we always see
-0.835881	the overall profitability and gross
-0.95922476	which is accretive to gross
-1.0969173	talk again to the gross
-1.107864	comes out of the gross
-1.2516619	very comfortable with the gross
-0.82179266	as a result the gross
-0.956999	then brian one on gross
-1.00754	you see that our gross
-1.0960126	is accretive on a gross
-1.3234006	guidance for full year gross
-0.98880404	can see on slide gross
-1.6127094	changes in foreign currency gross
-0.8173919	pre booking weakness about gross
-0.8048928	which typically have lower gross
-0.95805544	being higher than the margin
-0.8338764	just strictly timing the margin
-1.2676152	you're going to have margin
-0.8071776	more technology just lower margin
-0.30884492	overall profitability and gross margin
-0.12845184	again to the gross margin
-0.12845184	out of the gross margin
-0.12845184	comfortable with the gross margin
-0.12845184	a result the gross margin
-0.30884492	brian one on gross margin
-0.30884492	accretive on a gross margin
-0.30884492	see on slide gross margin
-0.30884492	booking weakness about gross margin
-0.9617743	i guess just to better
-0.8376135	self could come in better
-0.70742375	of which was slightly better
-0.7847899	those are typically much better
-0.8372598	key balance sheet and cash
-1.2868731	generating a lot of cash
-0.60505825	related expenses and non cash
-0.5499617	estimate that the non cash
-0.52146184	providing excludes the non cash
-0.5499617	of excluding the non cash
-0.5455566	ebitda guidance excludes non cash
-0.5455566	than plan excluding non cash
-0.65389764	our credit facilities plus cash
-0.3035002	our uses of free cash
-0.3035002	think is positive free cash
-0.40023458	the us at this point
-0.40023458	us business at this point
-0.40023458	wolfskin but at this point
-0.40023458	the others at this point
-0.40023458	not commenting at this point
-0.83415115	i just wanted a point
-0.8349854	to be at that point
-0.81408924	forward and at what point
-0.64940745	sales back at some point
-0.64940745	for quarterly at some point
-0.9287359	acquisition and a basis point
-0.52425027	i think to brian's point
-0.52425027	casey alexander from compass point
-0.9563502	we will see it impact
-0.20277882	periods in the negative impact
-0.20277882	to cover the negative impact
-0.30562907	in while a negative impact
-0.30562907	a basis point negative impact
-0.30562907	by an estimated negative impact
-1.0421277	a little foreign currency impact
-0.73673785	there was some profitability impact
-0.79897106	first on the equipment margins
-0.8722302	as well the club margins
-0.6185749	believe that the ball margins
-0.7491542	where those golf ball margins
-0.68991214	chip and our ball margins
-0.38367748	is accretive to gross margins
-0.38367748	see that our gross margins
-0.38367748	for full year gross margins
-0.38367748	in foreign currency gross margins
-0.38367748	typically have lower gross margins
-0.7366274	are typically much better margins
-1.0184742	with some very good points
-1.0417677	neutral is couple of points
-0.6346829	margins was a basis points
-0.5712735	that there was basis points
-0.5712735	year there's probably basis points
-0.5712735	it's only down basis points
-0.52496195	opened now your alternative points
-1.2885187	first quarter of this decrease
-0.9573855	discussed last quarter the decrease
-0.9573855	guidance of million the decrease
-0.9118924	of million in a decrease
-0.9118924	same period in a decrease
-0.7945109	exchanges and the expected decrease
-0.948216	was a basis points decrease
-0.52460593	originates and the concomitant decrease
-0.60644096	of this increase was primarily
-0.60644096	quarter this increase was primarily
-0.79898137	of this decrease was primarily
-0.9769215	all over in europe primarily
-0.52514005	other expense in resulted primarily
-1.4232194	quarter of which is attributable
-0.83352375	this decrease was primarily attributable
-1.178044	to due to the seasonality

-0.5252091	sales for the upcoming fallwinter
-0.8177482	in regards to jack wolfskin's
-0.72445923	now expect that jack wolfskin's
-1.0721532	be to lower than previously
-0.81896204	quarter we had not previously
-1.4024327	to break out the estimates

-0.9760417	first quarter we are increasing
-1.0627108	of million we are increasing
-0.8078294	costs and a lower effective
-1.0683283	tax rate which is estimated
-0.8179085	and amortization expense is estimated
-1.1374818	the decrease in the estimated

-0.8379562	estimated to be in figures
-0.8934552	north america is my estimate
-1.0681607	don't really have a estimate
-0.99548733	our previous guidance we estimate
-0.8249135	foreign currency impact we estimate
-0.8193629	can't give you an estimate
-0.52478385	would assume it's premature estimate
-1.2653706	the timing of the incremental
-0.96262753	is a period of incremental

-0.07136682	coming in the second half
-0.47247446	reasons during the second half
-1.0986427	of is due to software
-0.93561095	that integrates with other software
-0.65437716	it designing your own software
-1.097653	and china which is impacting
-1.0154527	to three given the orders
-0.89097977	the fallwinter pre book orders
-0.52514005	guess where the lighter orders
-1.1214843	are even on the little
-0.7433693	it will be a little
-0.71508217	got off to a little
-0.88423294	as well as a little
-0.71508217	it was up a little
-0.81163603	they've always had a little
-0.63983715	datatech have declined a little
-0.71508217	is probably getting a little
-0.7433693	and so it's a little
-0.3491194	can you elaborate a little
-0.63983715	and has improved a little
-0.71508217	it was down a little
-0.63983715	you could talk a little
-0.63983715	in we went a little
-0.82931393	also on slide we're refining
-0.7993722	to million which would represent
-0.5252091	softer pre bookings historically represent
-0.94299066	period in it also reflects
-1.0366987	in the prior year reflects
-1.0208459	to the new guidance reflects
-0.9642802	it also reflects the shift

-0.9581435	not really looking for greater
-0.83019704	i'm assuming travismathew was greater
-0.8372127	earnings are anticipated to occur
-0.92874986	generally results in operating loss
-0.65447	pre bookings historically represent loss
-1.4046578	mostly related to the launches

-0.5253164	are weighted more heavily towards
-1.2211807	towards the first half conversely
-1.089571	conversely for the same reasons
-0.79085004	we repurchase some shares during
-0.52514005	for the same reasons during

-1.0480834	congrats on the quarter just
-0.6759546	of the business i'm just
-0.6759546	both of those i'm just
-0.81168747	new york coming up just
-0.96381056	with callaway and travismathew just
-0.7395026	much better margins than just
-0.7395026	of products broader than just
-0.8240641	question i have was just
-0.82589996	tour with travismathew so just
-0.7892306	and having more technology just
-1.085688	and then last one just

-0.9726625	got it and then just
-0.46095523	okay great and then just
-0.8010037	to start recouping share just
-1.5522078	your line is open just
-0.79294205	into my second question just
-0.9214497	wouldn't surprise me if just
-1.0417755	pre bookings i guess just
-0.9767742	brand in north america just
-0.52159154	see international development accelerate just
-1.0331335	project share so i don't
-1.0582304	of visibility that we don't
-0.79819274	new reporting segments we don't
-0.79819274	from that perspective we don't
-0.79819274	also apparel susan we don't
-0.9322207	and then we really don't
-0.9642802	we don't have the details
-0.8344917	have the details on woods
-1.3123698	clubs number one in woods
-0.65437716	expect your right tiger woods
-1.006093	market share is it within
-0.7361583	comment on which categories within
-0.9570212	i'm sure i believe within
-1.07199	quite healthy and we're within
-0.82940817	of our range but within
-0.9237182	chrome soft and it's within
-0.9606662	share overall so it's within
-1.0368481	investment opportunities as you saw
-0.825276	new launches like we saw
-0.9960243	core business what we saw
-0.77790993	within the club segments saw
-1.3677362	the first quarter and maybe
-0.81878364	are you making more maybe
-1.4588466	and then i guess maybe
-1.1277487	brand because of the broader
-0.83422583	do you see the broader
-0.79560804	in terms of products broader
-1.4575615	you look at our competitive
-0.79719007	you see the broader competitive
-0.6546147	see the broader competitive backdrop
-0.8312305	years and the so far
-0.65447	in the clubs thus far
-1.0084254	the share you are correct
-1.0106914	i think that our correct
-0.7554413	good quarter on irons correct
-0.52496195	what you just articulated correct
-0.81513673	diving into this and obviously
-0.81513673	is part currency and obviously
-0.81513673	on irons correct and obviously
-0.81513673	winning the masters and obviously
-0.97498053	on that going forward obviously
-0.9662829	sales so you can obviously
-0.82409644	it sounds like it's obviously
-0.52478385	you the future quarter's obviously
-0.8290713	the transformation process and if
-0.8290713	their largest period and if
-0.5424688	that our correct me if
-0.5424688	it wouldn't surprise me if
-1.029382	expected outcome for us if
-0.806101	obviously the categories overall if
-0.704991	significant it'd be hard if
-0.8276712	average euro so but if
-0.82850647	related to fx so if
-0.8175942	i call co brand if
-0.73413575	a warm probably winter if
-1.1414948	business at this point if
-0.98930824	those new product launches if
-0.73413575	share you are correct if
-0.6519848	in the design space if
-1.0742657	they are in the marketplace
-1.0742657	competitive performance in the marketplace
-1.0742657	has momentum in the marketplace
-0.8378097	performing very strongly and showing
-0.8291461	in the marketplace we're showing
-1.0697299	right the brand is really
-0.8156129	we are hearing is really
-1.0042106	other segments that are really
-1.0876203	golf courts and we really
-1.0242053	enough and then we really
-1.0981616	very strong as well really
-1.0685934	right now and we're really
-0.80960375	out was is currency really
-0.68859714	consumers alex i'm not really
-0.7311479	point we have not really
-0.75958437	with that we're not really
-0.6174588	garage but that's not really
-0.73413575	share so i don't really
-0.6519848	the marketplace we're showing really
-0.8108708	that you've done really really
-0.6519848	things that you've done really
-0.9358243	nature of the synergies really
-0.5233622	most of those won't really
-0.8327098	wasn't as cooperative as we'd
-1.0365971	up right now so we'd
-1.0147908	the position we're in throughout
-0.77808464	met or exceeded expectations throughout
-0.9642802	we're in throughout the entire
-1.1083091	that's helpful thank you okay
-0.7744682	close to our expectations okay
-0.82721335	and other got it okay
-0.82721335	the wholesale got it okay
-0.8022745	that currency impacted were okay
-1.1213326	our golf ball business okay
-1.0976425	the year as well okay
-0.8893149	that's despite fx headwinds okay
-0.8089412	would be increased currency okay
-0.8048272	travismathew to begin here okay
-0.7044522	the entire club portfolio okay
-0.752009	in the marketplace currently okay
-0.7983742	be at that point okay
-0.80737436	have good scale yes okay
-0.5230075	long term outlook mike okay
-0.6515079	are jumping on board okay
-0.64793986	then chip can you elaborate
-0.68651366	wolfskin so can you elaborate
-0.64793986	share just can you elaborate
-1.1345471	year it is a bit
-0.8215792	hearing is really a bit
-0.22629672	off to a little bit
-0.22629672	was up a little bit
-0.22629672	always had a little bit
-0.22629672	have declined a little bit
-0.22629672	probably getting a little bit
-0.14937794	you elaborate a little bit
-0.22629672	has improved a little bit
-0.22629672	was down a little bit
-0.22629672	could talk a little bit
-0.70781636	were down a fair bit
-1.1084527	was it looks like you're
-0.799434	inflection based on where you're
-0.82240003	assume that plus that you're
-1.1150925	and i think that you're
-1.0134654	separately run but also you're
-0.9043024	bit more on what you're
-0.73759127	are they still what you're
-0.8021072	we never know when you're
-0.6825358	of curious of how you're
-0.5874054	of curious on how you're
-0.5874054	just curious on how you're
-0.6825358	travismathew just curious how you're
-1.7156072	in the second half you're
-0.71595436	it'd be hard if you're
-0.71595436	the design space if you're
-0.9959549	the guidance i think you're
-0.9959549	pretty soon i think you're
-0.7295665	yes okay and secondly you're
-0.5233622	point of clarification understanding you're
-0.73413575	begin here okay randy you're
-0.83074707	currently sold are you seeing
-0.83074707	where exactly are you seeing
-0.93253165	more on what you're seeing
-0.9601145	over year basis and that's
-1.0776403	board okay got it that's
-0.8138782	and such definitely thanks that's
-2.0147822	the jack wolfskin business that's
-0.8276712	of your garage but that's
-1.0472962	during q and so that's
-0.7882835	that we're expecting great that's
-0.8147826	poster there and how that's
-0.87337756	other got it okay that's
-0.7225625	despite fx headwinds okay that's
-0.704991	on what you're seeing that's
-0.9999529	the jack wolfskin yes that's
-0.704991	just lower margin percent that's
-0.5233622	helping a good chunk that's
-0.80793464	what you're seeing that's resulting
-0.9906067	resulting in the guidance cut
-1.0900097	and ebitda is the weakness
-0.65447	of the pre booking weakness
-1.0663334	it sounds like the bookings
-1.3873589	to break out the bookings
-0.83512056	but we factored our bookings
-0.8376135	is the weakness in bookings
-0.5730734	business and the pre bookings
-0.5730734	questions about the pre bookings
-0.70133847	this do softer pre bookings
-0.77826136	the weakness in bookings equally
-0.5253164	weakness in bookings equally spread
-0.52514005	in bookings equally spread between
-0.7685566	identified some additional synergies between
-0.52514005	in north america sometime between
-0.6546147	is it more weighted toward
-0.83794856	toward one region and along
-0.7687956	and along those same lines
-1.1043109	but the industry is still
-0.92284447	of the purchase accounting still
-0.8055264	little bit but we're still
-0.8055264	next year so we're still
-0.71457326	the golf ball we're still
-0.71457326	those same lines we're still
-0.92295617	that business and it's still
-0.92295617	have received but it's still
-0.7836647	sounds like it's obviously still
-0.81297374	okay and secondly you're still
-0.8084241	still achievable are they still
-0.6531793	confirm are those targets still
-0.95668393	our brand strength is pretty
-1.6183877	we're going to be pretty
-0.98791254	were down it's a pretty
-0.8197846	it doesn't apply a pretty
-0.96166015	played data came in pretty
-1.2137264	and so we have pretty
-0.8270937	i think overall we're pretty
-0.82929146	perspective in q so pretty
-0.8225832	a transformation process it's pretty
-0.98242104	same lines we're still pretty
-0.5238948	type of an approach pretty
-1.2106906	shipments in q and early
-1.0136461	seeing any type of early
-0.70742375	north america sometime between early
-0.7988734	lines we're still pretty early
-1.0525357	the year and it gives
-0.94299066	strong indicator it also gives
-0.8156714	year here so what gives
-0.83401304	so what gives you confidence
-0.81878364	also gives us more confidence
-0.7076949	improved visibility and improved confidence
-1.0313219	new guidance is an achievable
-0.79557073	are those targets still achievable
-0.96032214	and so that's a level
-0.65447	guidance is an achievable level
-1.6692336	so the jack wolfskin let
-1.042182	but we wanted to answer
-0.7557099	jack wolfskin let me answer
-0.737028	numbers did that any answer
-0.77826136	so the apparel businesses operates
-0.5253164	the apparel businesses operates differently
-1.0140971	it's resonating outside of traditional
-1.0776058	don't have in our traditional
-0.82175785	operates differently than our traditional
-0.83314115	business and that it works
-0.96228135	out some medium to longer
-0.8345601	that it works on longer
-1.0902835	season which is the shipments
-0.83401304	last question when you came
-0.8205272	the year those all came
-0.65437716	the rounds played data came
-0.95521414	to give you i basically
-0.96335566	those all came in basically
-0.83730686	that's a level of visibility
-0.8113991	we have pretty strong visibility
-0.7076949	it gives us improved visibility
-0.83443654	correct currency neutral is couple
-1.0827539	your learnings from the couple
-0.83521026	also in china a couple
-0.94587505	ahead of the next couple
-0.8383913	light on what the different
-1.042249	china a couple of different
-1.0113772	factors one was a general
-0.99920756	down that market in general
-0.82479656	the wholesale channel in general
-0.82479656	industry i guess in general
-0.7373153	one was a general slowing
-1.1347371	general slowing of the economies
-0.34078172	lining that and i think
-0.34078172	face technology and i think
-0.34078172	our position and i think
-0.3749778	that you reported i think
-0.3749778	to range in i think
-0.3749778	presence here that i think
-0.38122076	the jack wolfskin i think
-0.3990137	on jack wolfskin i think
-0.3749778	on the guidance i think
-0.41424447	target of sure i think
-0.3749778	the apparel segment i think
-0.2626003	wolfskin in but i think
-0.2626003	i'm wrong but i think
-0.2626003	is helping but i think
-0.3749778	over there which i think
-0.43529478	continue selling so i think
-0.3749778	million of revenue i think
-0.3749778	just talked about i think
-0.3749778	a million headwind i think
-0.3749778	overall consumer interest i think
-0.3749778	jack wolfskin yes i think
-0.3749778	longer term goals i think
-0.3749778	volume or pricing i think
-0.3749778	think it's improving i think
-0.3749778	approach pretty soon i think
-0.25811267	now versus where you think
-0.4262313	just wondering where you think
-0.89650834	driver how do you think
-0.89650834	here how do you think
-0.9496317	the consumer and we think
-0.9859301	fine with that we think
-0.87203526	are generating what we think
-0.5212883	or how should we think
-0.5212883	how much should we think
-0.73784685	overall i mean we think
-0.73784685	found some areas we think
-0.73784685	that are clearly we think
-0.73784685	with the consumers we think
-0.8088878	for you i do think
-1.0494083	how do you guys think
-0.81324685	think have been well documented
-1.0531304	scale yes okay and secondly
-0.8315607	been well documented and secondly
-0.83364034	and jack wolfskin is probably
-1.0551034	and secondly and a probably
-1.0288203	months ago there was probably
-0.80868226	establishing a partnership they probably
-0.7066113	they had a warm probably
-0.78425264	had this year there's probably
-0.6534186	down the road it'll probably
-0.819113	and a probably more cute
-1.0311661	the margin is an issue
-0.52514005	a probably more cute issue
-0.7797526	of an industry wide issue
-1.2660469	now is that the weather
-0.83362454	year which means the weather
-0.958405	in europe now on weather
-0.76786315	challenged from that same weather
-0.76786315	america is my estimate weather
-0.7366274	we didn't have average weather
-0.96158475	pretty good performance we didn't
-0.87317693	is that the weather didn't
-0.6546147	that the weather didn't cooperate
-0.8347023	the fallwinter period is their
-0.96262753	no choice because of their
-0.73712546	then we have offset their
-1.0898337	the wholesale is the largest
-0.75562847	a lifestyle brand its largest
-0.7076949	fallwinter period is their largest
-0.8351933	at certain markets and they
-0.8304716	targets still achievable are they
-0.83349156	in the channels that they
-1.0560763	some point this year they
-0.8134496	the first half than they
-0.81750005	done it contributed or they
-1.1932015	as gear and other they
-0.6517462	other they have footwear they
-0.9236698	largest period and if they
-1.0165815	here that i think they
-1.1290455	versus where you think they
-0.8077036	this new reclassification yes they
-0.70472157	have at the prices they
-0.52318484	footwear they have tents they
-0.52318484	retailers establishing a partnership they
-1.0858811	if they had a warm
-0.83019704	means the weather was warm
-1.0322562	which was a very warm
-0.82283753	would that was also followed
-0.80791545	also followed by last summer
-0.7079635	was a very warm dry

-1.2302403	nice part of our direct
-0.96018517	wolfskin business that's a direct
-0.8339425	lower the forecast for direct
-0.79587686	consumer business both through e
-0.5253164	business both through e com
-0.8273035	with it designing your own
-1.084932	e com and our own
-0.6546147	com and our own retail
-0.81170434	pre bookings are strong indicator
-1.4121523	the quality of the forecast
-0.83422583	expecting to lower the forecast
-0.65447	numbers in this year's forecast
-0.82943827	wanted a point of clarification
-1.0941534	question also kind of clarification
-1.0125062	thank you for that clarification
-1.0429206	in the us and internationally
-1.0697658	investing in the brand internationally
-0.65447	the us and internationally played
-0.73253953	looks like the rounds played
-0.9481479	your expectations and at least
-1.391511	at some of the datatech
-0.8076593	that they report into datatech
-0.65447	like the rounds played data
-0.65447	some of the datatech data
-0.9833191	you expect to start recouping
-1.0997533	first quarter on a global
-0.8312083	or the brand in north
-0.76199967	was flat here in north
-0.76199967	will launch here in north
-1.6687124	so the jack wolfskin north
-0.201671	the brand in north america
-0.17543489	flat here in north america
-0.17543489	launch here in north america
-0.30372956	the jack wolfskin north america
-1.0647961	or not but it wasn't
-0.7686075	is my estimate weather wasn't
-0.95667225	estimate weather wasn't as cooperative
-1.0599743	to neutral right now quite
-1.0320176	for the next year quite
-0.8050707	shares last year were quite
-0.79513633	the industry is still quite
-0.79756486	think two things you said
-0.79756486	i think prior you said
-1.1190739	in i think you said
-1.080652	have expected so we said
-0.8225094	i think you also said
-1.0228268	technology for us and candidly
-0.9465066	a healthy market and candidly
-0.9465066	we are flat and candidly
-0.8178806	hard time keeping up candidly
-0.80762756	across the board has candidly
-0.9519934	flat and candidly we're fine
-1.3091223	we had a very tough
-0.5253164	had a very tough comp
-1.1379067	shares now in the channels
-0.79115427	as well really across channels
-1.3128786	woods number one in drivers
-1.3128786	drivers number one in fairway
-0.5253164	number one in fairway wood
-1.3128786	wood number one in hybrids
-0.37289423	the number one selling model

-0.6546147	i'm not all together too
-0.5253164	not all together too disappointed

-0.93221086	afternoon guys thanks for taking
-0.8145612	of clarification understanding you're taking
-0.8342867	of the acquisition you laid
-1.1379067	go in in the medium
-0.9492357	you laid out some medium
-0.81468266	medium to longer term goals
-1.0425605	i just wanted to confirm
-0.81798214	to confirm are those targets
-0.5252091	the long term synergy targets
-1.1079148	what you're kind of aiming
-0.95540655	the long term outlook mike
-1.2797686	question and kind of piggybacking
-1.0467359	piggybacking on one of brett's
-0.7893491	distribution going forward it looks
-0.9928363	this earlier but it looks
-0.89974105	brett's questions was it looks
-0.9584001	like you're looking for organic
-0.77879214	looking from callaway i mean
-0.77879214	you just overall i mean
-0.77879214	across the geographies i mean
-0.8947008	is being share versus unit
-0.79719007	to continue to build volume
-0.5252091	being share versus unit volume
-0.8215165	versus unit volume or pricing
-0.79961145	correct me if i'm wrong
-1.0693233	than what you just articulated
-0.8273163	do think we'll be stronger
-0.819113	it's a little more difficult
-0.8369413	little more difficult to give
-0.80541575	point yes we can give
-0.65437716	you i basically can't give
-0.65447	competitor set that simply can't
-0.65447	give you i basically can't
-1.0424081	to help us and others
-0.8380383	of share versus the others
-0.79513633	to see that technology others
-1.0901368	synergies there are some others
-0.8364818	in a cycle that supports
-1.0104306	guidance i think you're saying
-0.9625018	i'm just trying to parse
-0.8146676	was is currency really almost
-0.8349655	really almost million is worse
-1.2158097	over the last several months
-0.7686075	than it was two months
-0.96173435	previously included when we gave
-0.8118569	be increased currency okay wonderful
-1.840927	from the line of daniel
-1.0860486	gross margins and then daniel
-0.6546147	the line of daniel imbro
-0.8250227	of daniel imbro from stephens
-1.2586064	of the long term synergy
-1.0690247	synergy targets you just talked
-0.5252091	and the marketing campaign talked
-0.8342867	your prepared remarks you noted
-0.82994044	noted you guys have identified
-1.3005171	leverage some of the synergies
-1.0818049	the nature of the synergies
-0.798539	think there are increased synergies
-1.0896463	though there are some synergies
-0.7071528	have identified some additional synergies
-0.52478385	talking about cost base synergies
-0.7079635	some additional synergies between existing
-1.6692336	in the jack wolfskin asset
-0.9385139	just provide some more detail
-0.99924004	now included in your updated
-0.8343778	of the year the nature
-0.8343778	at this point the nature
-0.83749	to build volume and come
-0.76817477	anticipation that self could come
-0.8139776	of the synergies really come
-0.73673785	i think randy you've come
-0.83704746	sales down two to three
-0.8248478	synergies really come from three
-0.55913275	apply it in other areas
-0.55913275	of ai in other areas
-0.82712954	but we've found some areas
-0.65437716	really come from three areas
-0.83704746	we'll look forward to talking
-0.73714036	and we're really only talking
-0.8200364	really only talking about cost
-0.5253164	only talking about cost base
-0.83480525	triple track technology is clearly
-1.0090787	some others that are clearly
-0.7166367	to be able to help
-0.7166367	will be able to help
-0.7080344	able to help them grow
-0.99562126	and others but it's supply
-0.5253164	others but it's supply chain
-0.82500386	soft goods business it's logistics
-0.7687956	those business and distribution centers
-0.82931393	centers and as we're diving
-1.1211809	several months we are literally
-0.5253164	months we are literally drinking
-1.0835773	literally drinking from the fire
-0.5253164	drinking from the fire hose
-1.1074743	a lot of good information
-0.7688364	of good information we've become
-0.87346816	more confident but we've found
-0.8297672	we will get this none
-1.0398526	into most of those won't
-0.7559284	those won't really even materialize
-0.5253164	won't really even materialize till
-0.5253164	really even materialize till late
-1.2797686	late and kind of scaling
-1.0371876	me if just the fact
-0.83422583	are very clear the fact
-0.96335566	up from there in fact
-1.120836	of growth we are investing
-0.8291461	there in fact we're investing
-0.7077999	a period of incremental investment
-0.65447	we're finding good attractive investment
-0.8357211	that has been our practice
-0.9271692	in golf so it appears
-0.8104683	the so far it appears
-1.0995638	it appears to be paying
-1.2472245	facility so we are paying
-0.83413523	paying off well for shareholders
-1.102625	of the business and such
-0.7077999	these noncore golf opportunities such
-0.6546147	the business and such definitely
-1.0376456	one on gross margin adjusting
-0.8273947	purchase accounting still some heavier
-0.8382927	the different buckets the pressure
-0.52514005	accounting still some heavier pressure
-0.52514005	europe with some macro pressure
-0.77865875	pressure in q i know
-0.77865875	go long term i know
-0.77865875	of an inflection i know
-0.77790993	a partnership they probably know
-0.52514005	average weather we never know
-1.0693233	but could you just shed
-0.9385139	just shed some more light
-0.6546147	on what the different buckets
-1.0841373	to that full year guided
-0.5253164	that full year guided target
-0.9985563	forward it looks like there's
-0.7583752	of golf feels like there's
-1.0597936	we had this year there's
-1.0528897	golf club equipment business there's
-0.81657505	in the past one there's
-0.8039576	of the time when there's
-0.52442807	obviously a big deal there's
-0.8901322	still very very small there's
-0.8181764	related to the one timers
-0.77822566	related to the inventory step
-0.83854467	has to do the cyclicality
-0.95237637	you alluded to this earlier
-0.8526302	cyclicality as chip mentioned earlier
-0.8272135	margin opportunity as your percent
-1.0243771	the business on what percent
-0.8051254	technology just lower margin percent
-0.96228135	you just have to remember
-0.65447	margins and then daniel remember
-0.9890289	element of that brand because
-0.65437716	and then daniel remember because
-0.52514005	channel has no choice because
-1.1104764	got it and we shouldn't
-1.0510741	headwinds like you guys called
-1.0175681	year but we're not commenting
-0.81308424	thanks so much guys best
-0.7077999	we do not susan best
-0.82277125	thanks so much good luck
-0.96273947	much guys best of luck
-1.8421767	from the line of john
-0.5253164	the line of john kernan
-0.8250227	of john kernan from cowen
-1.1008322	of travismathew continue to talk
-0.8730232	guess maybe you could talk
-1.2229122	sure can you just talk
-1.0091934	to talking to you again
-0.7077999	can you just talk again
-1.2155015	a bit of an inflection
-0.65447	apply a pretty big inflection
-1.0383685	i know there is obvious
-1.1741418	wolfskin business but it doesn't
-0.83704746	to learn how to apply
-0.5252091	business but it doesn't apply
-0.8355782	masters and obviously a big
-0.91266423	doesn't apply a pretty big
-0.8147391	based on where you're walking
-0.8208264	are you at all concerned
-1.6322854	we're going to be coming
-0.99393296	of new product launches coming
-0.52514005	here in new york coming
-0.81896204	since then but not anything
-0.70790166	overall we're pretty comfortable anything
-0.65447	we're pretty comfortable anything else
-0.5252091	and candidly for anybody else
-0.819113	as we get more experienced
-1.0402553	some of that is helping
-1.0512974	mixed perspective it is helping
-0.8372127	but i think to brian's
-0.82500386	to brian's point it's mostly
-0.8357381	half which from a mixed
-0.9925537	is helping a good chunk
-1.1257197	on the golf ball state
-0.9621397	work that has to go
-1.2571672	we think about that go
-0.7013627	you think it can go
-0.7013627	you think they can go
-0.8347023	gear and other is indiscernible
-1.0847243	triple track and our indiscernible
-0.65437716	it gets a wider indiscernible
-0.9237199	a lot of share gain
-0.8377204	of share gain and you've
-0.82482964	expertise or things that you've
-0.94605523	the new products that you've
-0.737028	yes i think randy you've
-0.7373153	share gain and you've invested
-1.1380913	a lot in the manufacturing
-0.89167637	the business i'm just wondering
-0.78308153	york coming up just wondering
-0.9584504	those golf ball margins lying
-0.96228135	in the medium to near
-1.1379067	some energy in the near
-0.7559284	still in a learning curve
-0.4937706	neutral right now quite frankly
-0.4937706	the next year quite frankly
-1.0829225	orders or are you making
-1.0088962	i guess you are making
-0.82903826	of the investments we're making
-1.119453	in chicopee and the efficiencies
-1.0064065	paying a short term penalty
-0.8273947	but we've got some upside
-1.0710597	that facility as we finish
-0.7559284	come up the learning curves
-0.83854467	which we're demonstrating the ability
-1.091788	we have the first move
-1.0708673	frankly but as we move
-0.83854467	move further down the road
-0.75574577	time that will scale it'll
-0.5252091	further down the road it'll
-0.797391	then just one final thematic
-1.0619884	thematic question about the sport
-1.002762	the sport of golf feels
-0.8078524	we expect your right tiger
-0.75588024	feels like there's momentum tiger
-0.6546147	like there's momentum tiger winning
-0.83854467	momentum tiger winning the masters
-0.6546147	and obviously a big deal
-1.1071676	a lot of good young
-1.2882869	are a lot of young
-0.30372956	lot of good young players
-0.30372956	a lot of young players
-0.7327127	of good young players excitement
-1.2590955	excitement building for the pga
-0.8147124	pga here in new york
-1.2104634	but that has been improving
-0.8248209	interest i think it's improving
-0.8274437	improving i think your metrics
-0.940771	your metrics are very clear
-1.0671902	it looks like the rounds
-0.8343778	an industry even the rounds
-0.8366374	have average weather we never
-1.1330795	in availability in the game
-1.1237832	very good for the game
-0.9642802	players out there the national
-0.7995398	a long time increased participation
-0.8078294	and interest get these noncore
-0.83283675	golf opportunities such as topgolf

-0.8264117	to be down at similar
-0.5253164	be down at similar amount
-0.9642802	i guess where the lighter
-0.82500386	i would assume it's premature
-0.8317399	premature estimate it i wouldn't
-1.1737787	remains that but it wouldn't
-1.0248848	consumer based on what happened
-0.7687956	wholesale channel has no choice
-0.7957335	inventory positions and open devices
-0.5253164	positions and open devices et
-0.5253164	and open devices et cetera
-1.0681953	et cetera that is absolutely
-0.7800697	absolutely an industry wide phenomenon
-1.0617318	wide phenomenon but the nice
-1.1638321	but it is a nice
-1.0440999	bit about just the health
-1.0745652	of industry across the geographies
-1.0833764	us how are you feeling
-0.99916726	in europe with some macro
-1.0264895	switching to golf ball specifically
-0.7076949	the year in japan specifically
-0.8964382	that both in asia specifically
-1.0671902	we do like the trend
-1.0680337	been improving so the trend
-0.9575348	this year our business though
-0.75574577	are operated separately even though
-1.0602599	there and continues to perform
-0.7830161	to the year which means
-0.7830161	weather was warm which means
-0.73714036	community building with digital means
-0.95357114	jack wolfskin business was challenged
-1.2476859	perspective so we are naturally
-0.5253164	so we are naturally hedged
-0.8184177	in the market is positive
-0.8184177	what we think is positive
-0.8357381	we'll call it a slow
-1.0507964	slow start in q roughly
-1.174432	improved a little bit since
-0.83392155	its largest customers are outside
-0.65437716	then but not anything outside
-0.73712546	resonating and it's resonating outside
-1.1347371	anything outside of the trends
-1.8380638	from the line of randy
-1.0132992	guys thank you thanks randy
-0.81146246	to begin here okay randy
-1.1007036	wolfskin yes i think randy
-0.7373153	the line of randy konik
-0.8250227	of randy konik from jefferies
-1.1184039	to start with the success
-0.9077801	more importantly the product seems
-1.0697658	lifestyle of the brand seems
-1.0995638	brand seems to be wider
-0.8355782	and it gets a wider
-1.0529867	be wider and it gets
-1.289361	indiscernible in terms of demand
-1.117952	resonated nicely with the consumers
-0.4309777	how that's resonating with consumers
-0.4309777	is clearly resonating with consumers
-0.52514005	in terms of demand consumers
-1.1102796	that brand and we want
-0.836331	of demand consumers that want
-0.9625018	consumers that want to buy
-0.8274437	guys think about your learnings
-1.042249	from the couple of stores
-0.83352375	have opened a few stores
-0.68804103	of stores you have opened
-0.68804103	few stores you have opened
-0.8274437	have opened now your alternative
-0.7958116	when should we see international
-1.0898337	forward what is the development
-0.90762305	that in other product development
-0.52514005	should we see international development
-0.7079635	we see international development accelerate
-0.8274437	of curious on your thoughts
-0.7373722	on your thoughts around what's
-0.99472666	really resonating and it's resonating
-0.93176603	the brand is really resonating
-0.80743384	there and how that's resonating
-0.6541373	track technology is clearly resonating
-0.8298118	golf brand is golf dna
-0.7079635	lifestyle brand its largest customers
-1.0777702	golf and it is worn
-1.2179823	worn on the golf courts
-0.7960138	but also off golf courts
-0.9326712	courts and we really find
-0.82277125	flow we're finding good attractive
-1.0313219	find that is an attractive
-0.65437716	that is an attractive element
-0.65437716	is a nice added element
-0.52514005	create ourselves the finite element
-0.797391	because of the broader reach
-0.7995398	going to be pretty measured
-0.9625018	and we want to control
-1.1380913	and we're in the middle
-1.0429206	associated with it and efforts
-0.82723325	a starting up some efforts
-0.86149085	europe those are very small
-0.40878597	been a very very small
-0.40878597	it's still very very small
-1.1191599	the product and the added
-0.65447	it is a nice added
-0.8344917	the organization together on plans
-0.8354223	and we're putting our plans
-0.7852758	the past one there's plans
-0.95086044	good afternoon just to expand
-0.82845956	one there's plans to expand
-0.8116541	you're thinking about time lining
-1.1079148	be run kind of independently
-0.8181764	of independently but one area
-0.44186574	we expect it to leverage
-0.8054999	or that business can leverage
-1.1374818	strength is in the digital
-1.1075327	leverage off of our digital
-0.8304105	and community building with digital
-0.7368763	around this particularly around digital
-0.8378097	around digital marketing and community
-0.8373908	the digital side of community
-0.6546147	digital side of community communities
-1.074337	across things like the ship
-0.7995637	ship show or callaway live
-0.8215165	live with callaway or life
-0.81144655	have a hard time keeping
-1.3505144	how you're thinking about keeping
-1.1592089	the business i guess separately
-0.5252091	and callaway are operated separately
-0.8147391	run but also you're bringing
-1.1076912	you're bringing kind of expertise
-0.75581396	digital and brand building expertise
-1.1184866	epic flash and the marketing
-1.0119858	customer respond to that marketing
-0.76817477	small there's been no marketing
-0.73673785	this particularly around digital marketing
-0.93855935	points there they're not lost
-1.0643065	here in north america sometime
-0.98577917	year so we're still dialing
-1.1380913	still dialing in the specifics
-1.1380913	it should in the ballpark
-0.83854467	year we're putting the organization
-1.0431433	the travismathew brand and parallel
-0.785435	and parallel positions back office
-1.0739379	callaway golf and we're sharing
-0.8373908	access those types of resources
-0.82723325	and we're sharing some resources
-0.9264146	to what i call co
-1.0138613	look at how we operate
-0.83423334	travismathew and callaway are operated
-1.0093629	some synergies that are invisible

-0.82943827	about the use of ai
-0.82943827	you about utilization of ai
-0.5252091	that our technology delivers ai
-1.119453	of ai and the algorithm
-0.8313891	and the algorithm so forth
-0.9642802	so forth how the customer
-0.5253164	forth how the customer respond
-0.7373153	respond to that marketing messaging
-0.81896204	space if you're not using
-0.73714036	you think about particularly using

-0.7374275	the development of epic flesh
-0.5253164	development of epic flesh taught
-0.8200364	flesh taught you about utilization
-1.0476897	it appears to have resonated
-1.3673801	we think that the reason
-0.80554235	and the added ball speed
-0.79575956	speed that our technology delivers
-0.83413523	us and candidly for anybody
-1.1380913	anybody else in the design
-1.0438536	i believe within the space
-0.5252091	else in the design space
-1.0148634	that type of an approach
-0.7995398	of an approach pretty soon
-0.8372127	lot we're starting to learn
-1.0440999	broader than just the face
-0.6546147	have the first move advantage
-1.6342871	it's going to be something
-1.0852551	product line and our technologies
-0.8379562	and our technologies in broad

-0.81817603	afford to access those types
-1.071802	of resources is that possible
-1.0499394	will be a little harder
-1.0671902	it's not like the supercomputer

-0.5253164	we have to create ourselves
-0.83854467	to create ourselves the finite
-0.7079635	ourselves the finite element analysis
-0.83794856	finite element analysis and predictive
-0.80784845	has to go into creating
-0.83854467	go into creating the algorithms
-1.0315646	algorithms it is an example
-0.83752126	is an example of item
-0.7687956	could lead to further consolidation
-0.83794856	to further consolidation and helps
